[+] re:Invent 2024, hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian December 3, 2024. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services)\\nGetty Images for Amazon Web Services\\nThere is no shortage of announcements and talks at AWS’s re:Invent conference here in Vegas this week—from AWS CEO Matt Garman and President & CEO of Amazon (AMZN) Andy Jassy to partners like Apple (AAPL).\\nLast month I wrote about how artificial intelligence (AI) will redefine our workplaces at scale; and last week Salesforce Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff penned an essay in TIME on how agentic AI can deliver unlimited digital labor that will upend industries, societies and GDP.\\nAgentic AI is becoming a force-multiplier that can tie the various threads of AI together and turn “workplace transformation” from consulting-speak into operational realities for your company. Let’s unpack agentic AI’s market traction, how it can help deliver on the promise, and new capabilities that C-suite leaders can look to for help.\\nAI Agents (Suggesting) Vs. Agentic AI (Acting)\\nThe phrase “agentic AI” has received a lot of attention from technologists, analysts, and enterprises, leaving some to wonder what all the excitement is about. Discerning human agents from AI agents and agentic AI can understandably be confusing. The latter term has its roots in psychology. “Agentic” denotes the concept of agency, or the sense of control and the ability to handle tasks and situations.\\nA recent NY Times article attributed the “agentic AI ”term’s origins to AI researcher Andrew Ng. It describes AI systems that exhibit agency. This means AI that can autonomously pursue goals, make decisions, and dynamically adapt to changing conditions without human intervention. These systems operate with a higher level of independence than traditional AI, often exhibiting capabilities like goal setting, prioritization, and collaboration.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, December 4th\\n### Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, December 4\\nAgentic AI differs from simpler \"AI agents\" because it focuses on independence, self-directed action, and broader functionality in handling complex tasks and environments. You could say, it can do things without humans. AI agents, on the other hand, have been around for decades. The rise of machine and deep learning in the 2010s introduced cognitive intelligence. Generative AI (like GPT models) in the 2020s added sophisticated natural language understanding and reasoning, creating a through line from traditional AI agents to agentic AI.\\nIf you are wondering whether you should pay attention to this one: Gartner estimates that by 2028, 33% of enterprises will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024. That’s a yes!\\nHouston, We Still Have a Productivity Problem\\nSome may wonder what this next generation of AI tech really means in terms of applications. What kind of problems can it solve, and how can it elevate AI’s role in transforming the workplace, safely, with all the guardrails everyone is talking about?\\nAt its core, much of this advancement boils down to improved information access, actionable insights and task automation. Despite technological progress, employees still spend too much time and effort searching for information in siloed systems, navigating multiple applications, and managing routine tasks.\\nAnyone who’s worked for an enterprise can relate—I know I can. Common frustrations include searching for company documents buried in Slack, SharePoint or Outlook, or tracking down customer information spread across multiple systems. Workers often must juggle countless applications, spending hours each week on tasks that could be automated. According to Forrester, knowledge workers spend 30% of their time looking for information and 80% believe reducing silos is a top priority.\\nAt first glance, these challenges resemble those that digital transformation, workflow and automation technologies have aimed to solve for years. Sure, AI should be able to help and is progressing by leaps and bounds. But solving these kinds of problems transcends the typical GenAI chat and content creation use cases that everyone is familiar with by now. Large language model (LLM) prompt-based applications and copilot tools can\\'t handle complexity—they hallucinate or remain siloed in individual applications.\\nAs the future of work becomes increasingly driven by AI, enterprises need secure and scalable AI tools that empower teams with out-of-the-box capabilities to work more effectively, streamline processes, and significantly reduce time spent on routine tasks.\\nEnterprises Need AI Concierge Brain Trusts\\nAnother technology is Kore.ai’s AI for Work, just announced today. It is a good example of how cutting-edge technology can reshape our workplaces. The NVIDIA-backed Gartner Magic Quadrant company is accelerating AI adoption and delivering results with a single, secure platform that combines intelligent enterprise search, workflow automation, and multi-agent orchestration.\\nThe company’s roots lie in enterprise tech., and Kore has developing GenAI integration over the past couple of years. With AI for Work, they are apparently unleashing a conversational, generative, and agentic AI triple threat.\\nI spoke with CEO and Founder Raj Koneru, who explained further: “This isn\\'t just another tool - it\\'s a fundamental transformation in how enterprises harness AI to make work more efficient, intelligent, and valuable across all levels of the organization. Early customer beta results show 30-50% faster information retrieval, workflow automation, and higher productivity overall.”\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show with Dean DeBiase and Raj Koneru\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show 2024\\nThe no-code AI platform includes prebuilt AI agents and templates for common business workflows and over 100+ integrations to enterprise systems. Its universal orchestrator manages interactions across diverse AI agents, ensuring seamless, secure, and context-aware task execution.\\nBaby Steps And Real World Examples\\nAI for Work enables decision-making for processes, which will be a boon for those struggling with limited data or document analysis resources. Kore’s AI agents can scale enterprises\\' capabilities, and help teams boost productivity—which will hopefully lead to smarter decisions.\\nFor example, it could transform the access to and synthesis of information from numerous sources through intelligent information handling. Instead of toggling between multiple systems, a salesperson could simply request \"Show me ABC Corp\\'s support history\" to get a 360-degree view spanning CRM info, help desk data, email, meeting summaries and financial accounts status—all from one place.\\nAI for Work can also streamline complex business processes that require multiple handoffs and system interactions through intelligent workflow automation. It’s designed to coordinate complex workflows across specialized AI agents that can search, reason, summarize, generate content, and directly integrate with APIs to seamlessly deliver multistep process execution. It may sound complicated, but typical use cases can be real simple: employee/customer onboarding or IT service management.\\nWhen I asked Koneru for a live example, he referenced Yuliya Teteryuk, Customer Care Director at Autodoc, a German online auto parts retailer, who said: \"Generative AI is shaking up every aspect of work. That\\'s why we partnered to integrate AI into our customer and employee support operations. We have observed 74% first-call resolution and significant savings. Our people are happier. We are excited about the simplicity, potential and benefits AI for Work brings to the table.” I like the sound of happier people.\\nA Booming Field Of Utopian Options\\nIn addition to LLMs and SLMs which I covered last week, providers are jumping into the agentic AI fray big time. For example, Salesforce announced Agentforce in September and continues its expansion. According to the company’s release, it’s “a groundbreaking suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle tasks in service, sales, marketing, and commerce, driving unprecedented efficiency and customer satisfaction.” That’s a mouthful.\\nJust last month, Microsoft’s blog shared news about its autonomous agents that “scale your team like never before,” via agentic tech that advances Microsoft 365 Copilot, making it possible to create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\\nSalesforce’s Benioff emphasizes the importance of collaborative approaches as the world moves to an agentic utopia in his TIME essay: “Harnessing the power of agentic AI effectively will require a multistakeholder approach – businesses, governments, nonprofits, and academia working together to create guardrails and guidelines. The benefits… [for] individuals and businesses will far outweigh the initial disruptions.” Agreed.\\nHyper Competitive Era Ahead\\nThe opportunities ahead are becoming clearer to some C-suite leaders—larger than any single technology has previously enabled. Yes, agentic AI brings exciting new capabilities that promise to streamline and automate tasks, but its true power lies in integration with GenAI for content creation and actionable insights. Together, these advanced AI platforms democratize technological innovation, enabling employees to leverage intelligent tools without extensive technical expertise. By delivering immediate value across departments, these solutions should facilitate strategic technological transformation.\\nWe are entering a new era of workplace optimization that directly addresses critical enterprise challenges. The ultimate goal is to create a responsive, efficient organizational ecosystem where technology enhances human potential and helps to gain a competitive edge. The C-suite has never been so challenged to stay ahead of their competition through enabling technology. Buckle up, we are in the CaaS Era—Competitiveness-as-a-Service.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website\\xa0or\\xa0some of my other work\\xa0here.\\nDean DeBiase\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

[+] investments.\\ngetty\\nAI-based agents are very much having a moment right now. In recent months the topic has been pervasive across the events and marketing of many tech vendors, including Salesforce, Microsoft, ServiceNow, SAP, Amazon Web Services and Google. In many ways, the broad coverage and the promises about business impact are warranted: Agents represent the next evolution of generative AI capabilities and enable a more autonomous AI experience. Instead of just answering questions like AI chatbots do, agents can have tasks delegated to them by people or even other agents. It’s an exciting advance in AI technology, which is why I started writing about agents and their potential. And just like almost every aspect of AI, the technology is moving fast.\\nWhen I wrote my initial article on AI agents two months ago, the news cycle and product announcements were heavily focused on agents deployed within application platforms—with Salesforce serving as a key example. The purpose of these agents is to enable personal productivity and task automation within the context of the platform. So, for instance, consider a personal productivity agent that periodically scans multiple documents, summarizes the information in them and recommends actions to an end user. To stick with the Salesforce example, that might mean a quarterly scan of the prospect pipeline to see if there are new digital marketing opportunities and provide suggestions for tactics. These personal productivity agents provide some very helpful benefits to end users looking to get more done, more quickly.\\nThe Trouble With Personal Productivity Agents\\nThe problem is that while personal productivity agents are helpful, they are not always impactful. Personal productivity agents deployed in application platforms have been great in the sense that they have shown the overall potential of agents by leveling up an existing technology investment. And over time a percentage of these new agents are sure to deepen the connection between the users and the platform. But true business impact will be measured when a business sees a clear return on investment and spends net-new money on it, versus using something that’s included for free (or “free”) or that’s available for a slight incremental increase in price. And, sadly, I think personal productivity agents will not achieve that status, for three reasons.\\nUsage across teams drives business impact — It’s a good thing when a single employee finds a better way to do their job. But the biggest improvements come when that employee can reach out to other team members—and other functional groups—to improve an entire process. To put it another way, one or two developers writing code faster is nice, but it’s not likely to move up an application’s ship date.\\nPersonal productivity improvements do not increase the number of power users or super users — While AI has great potential, we have seen other technical breakthroughs in personal productivity applications languish in the field. Everyone has had a spreadsheet application on their desktops for decades. Yet despite all of the improvements in spreadsheets over the years, has the ratio of power users to total users changed? The answer seems to be no. And I say “seems” since there is no clear way to define a power user and quantify their impact.\\nPersonal tool-making technology is hard for IT to manage and govern — Over the years, increased personal productivity has been a benefit created by many tools. And vendors of technologies such as low- and no-code tools have touted the idea of individual empowerment by enabling people to make their own tools. While there are notable examples of this working for the individual, these tools also create many IT issues. Application sprawl, where many people create many apps that do sort of the same thing, is one key example. Another one is abandonment, where apps are just forgotten about and not used. The cost, governance and security issues created by these platforms can be a challenge for strapped IT teams.\\nImpactful Agents Will Be Enterprise-Focused\\nAgain, personal productivity agents do have utility, but the generative AI ecosystems still need to provide more measurable business value to justify strategic investments. We are starting to see signs that this is a possibility. For example, I recently covered UiPath and how it is approaching enterprise agentic development to accompany its robotic process automation solution, ideally leading to more efficient business processes. By taking a different approach to governance and agentic development, UiPath provides more breadth in building cross-enterprise agentic applications.\\nIn a slightly different context, consulting firms such as IBM are retooling how they deliver enterprise systems integration projects using their own enterprise-wide agent factories to reduce time-to-delivery and increase project quality. In researching these and other companies working on enterprise AI agents, I’ve found that, although the technology is different, the implementation still rests upon sound IT practices developed over the past 40 years. The key practices are:\\nStart with a meaningful cross-functional business problem — This means that the project needs to have at least one business metric that it impacts, for example deploying a technology that increases revenue yield without increasing the number of salespeople.\\nPlace a high priority on change management — While there is no measure of the ratio of power users to all users, most IT executives say that fewer than 20% of users are power users. Therefore, introducing any technology advancement must either be invisible to average end users or have sufficient change management applied such that it is adopted widely. For example, it’s possible that agents may be very helpful in providing inline assistance for average users thanks to the core capabilities of large language models—and that they will be adopted widely for this reason.\\nLeverage a solid technology foundation — Achieving success requires a solid set of technologies to build upon. Agentic applications touch a lot of diverse data, so ensuring that the data is well secured is critical. Over time, infrastructure in the form of reliable compute and storage is also important, especially as you scale the application across the enterprise.\\nDeliver with a well-thought-out framework — For a project to be deemed successful, you need a set of clear goals to measure against throughout the project lifecycle. Those goals and measures should come from a project framework that is either internally developed or produced by a reputable third party. In addition to solutions such as Consulting Advantage from IBM, startups such as Zavvis are automating common functional roles (in Zavvis’s case, the CFO’s) as the framework.\\nMake it sticky and usable for years to come — Big-bang projects are a temporary salve for older harmful practices. Instead of focusing on solving for today’s issues, design the solution such that it can become a new operational process delivering value and preventing the risk of needing another big-bang project.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### When Is Spotify Wrapped 2024 Coming Out? Here’s The Likely Release Date\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### Samsung Warning—Do Not Install These Apps On Your Galaxy S24 Or S23\\nAI ROI = Enterprise Agents + Established IT Practices\\nAgain, I am not trying to talk down about the first round of productivity agents. They do serve a purpose and honestly are a very good way to get stakeholders comfortable with AI. But when it comes to a leadership team making a real bet on a new technology I think the bar is—and should be—a bit higher.\\nThe good news is that we are starting to see meaningful efforts from multiple cloud, enterprise and startup technology vendors. And in some cases we are also seeing these new AI agentic technologies being leveraged to accelerate aspects of the implementation. That said, while technology speeds some things up, we are also seeing that the process to get there remains very similar to the well-worn path of enterprise technology adoption.\\nIn my next piece I’ll dig into some fresh examples of IT offerings coming into the marketplace that aim to achieve broader business results using agentic applications.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

It’s supposed to navigate retail websites for you, find the products you’re looking for, and even click the checkout button on your behalf.\\nPerplexity may be the first major AI startup to offer this, but others have been exploring the space for a while — so expect to see more AI shopping agents in 2025. OpenAI and Google are reportedly developing their own AI agents that can make purchases, such as booking flights and hotels. It would also make sense for Amazon, where millions of people already search for products, to evolve its AI chatbot, Rufus, to help with checkout as well.\\nTech companies are using a mix of new and old techniques to get around the barriers erected by retailers to block unwanted bots from using their sites. Rabbit released its LAM Playground earlier this month, which lets an AI agent navigate websites on your behalf using a computer in a data center. Anthropic’s computer use agent does the same thing, but it’s hosted on your personal computer.\\nMeanwhile, Perplexity is partnering with Stripe to leverage some older payments features that have been repurposed for AI agents.\\nStripe is allotting single-use debit cards for Perplexity’s AI agent to spend money with online — a repurposed version of the Stripe Issuing feature. This makes it so the agent can buy you a pair of socks without needing access to your entire bank account. That way, if it hallucinates, the agent just buys the wrong socks for a few bucks, and doesn’t spend your rent money on, well, socks.\\nGoogle’s AI agent reportedly needs access to your credit card information, which could give consumers pause. However, several companies already know your billing info – such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Shopify – and they regularly fill out forms for you when you’re shopping online. This could give these companies an advantage when they ship products in the space.\\nThese tools could reshape online shopping — something retailers and advertisers making a fortune from the status quo may not be happy about.\\nJust as AI chatbots have proven somewhat useful for surfacing information that’s hard to find through search engines, AI shopping agents have the potential to find products or deals that you might not otherwise have found on your own. In theory, these tools could save you hours when you need to book a cheap flight, or help you easily locate a good birthday present for your brother-in-law.\\nThere’s a long way to go before AI agents can buy everything on your holiday wishlist, but there’s a lot of companies vying to do it.\\nPerplexity’s shopping agent\\nBased on our early attempts, Perplexity’s shopping agent takes hours to process purchases, and sometimes runs into issues where it can’t purchase items at all. Overall, using the agent today seems more complicated than buying something on Amazon.\\nPerplexity also says there are human checkers involved to ensure its AI agent is working accurately. Having a “human in the loop” is not uncommon for the AI industry — but then, most AI chatbots don’t see the items I’m purchasing and my billing address. This raises some privacy issues for Perplexity, and whatever company is hiring its human checkers.\\nTechCrunch tested out Perplexity’s shopping agent by asking it to buy us toothpaste.\\nAfter prompting Perplexity with, “I’d like to buy toothpaste,” the agent returned several options from Walmart, Amazon, and some smaller websites. For a few options, Perplexity offers a button under the product called, “Buy with Pro” while other options take you straight to the website of the retailer. Buy with Pro is Perplexity’s shopping agent at work.\\nPrompting Perplexity’s Shopping agent (left), results (middle) and purchase confirmation (right) (Image Credit: Maxwell Zeff & Perplexity)\\nI chose a tube of Crest from Walmart. Without leaving the Perplexity app, I was able to checkout, and (seemingly) purchase the toothpaste. But instead of paying Walmart, my bank statement showed that I had paid Perplexity’s agent.\\nThree hours later, I received an email from Perplexity that its agent was not able to buy me the toothpaste, because it was sold out at Walmart. The next day, I tried to purchase another tube of Crest with Perplexity’s shopping agent. Eight hours later, I got a confirmation from Perplexity that it worked.\\nSo what gives? Why did my first purchase get rejected, and why did both take hours to complete?\\nWhile Perplexity Shopping might seem a lot like Amazon or the TikTok Shop, where you can buy items from a wide array of merchants who upload and manage storefronts on the platform, it’s actually completely different.\\nPerplexity’s AI agent seems to be scraping retailers’ websites and giving you information about their products. Because this process isn’t necessarily real-time, it can cause a disconnect between what Perplexity tells you and what a store actually has in stock, which appears to be what happened in my case.\\nPerplexity declined to comment on whether retailers like Walmart were aware that their products were appearing on its app. This suggests that their scraping and purchase process is not authorized by those companies — something that could complicate buying or returning items.\\nYou’re also not actually buying anything when you check out in Perplexity’s app. You’re paying Perplexity the exact amount that item costs, giving its AI agent instructions to buy a specific item, and telling it to fill out your name and shipping address in the process. Some time later, perhaps hours, the agent executes that task, or at least tries to.\\n“This is the equivalent of giving a small pot of money to an assistant in the real world, and give them rules about how they’re allowed to spend it,” said Stripe product lead Jeff Weinstein, who helped build Stripe’s AI agent toolkit, in an interview with TechCrunch.\\nBut instead of giving money (in a pot or otherwise) to a real human assistant, who I would trust to buy toothpaste on their own, Perplexity’s AI agent occasionally needs to be monitored by another human. And even then, it doesn’t always work.\\n“I can’t disclose specifics around how Buy with Pro works, but what I can say is that there is human oversight providing occasional support, which ensures that transactions are completed in a timely manner and we avoid issues like purchasing the wrong product,” said Perplexity spokesperson Sara Platnick in an email to TechCrunch.\\nThese days, hiring human checkers to watch AI systems is commonplace. Companies like Scale AI and Turing have built large businesses around the service.\\xa0But in this case, Perplexity declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions around how often human oversight was necessary, how involved humans are in the process, and whether human checkers are watching AI agents make purchases in real-time. The lack of transparency here may not bother everyone, but it’s certainly worth noting.\\nOnline shopping, without visiting websites\\nIf AI shopping agents really take off, it could mean less people going to online storefronts, where retailers have historically been able to upsell them or promote impulse purchases. It also means that advertisers may not get valuable information about shoppers, so they can be targeted with other products.\\nFor that reason, those very advertisers and retailers are unlikely to let AI agents disrupt their industries without a fight. That’s part of why companies like Rabbit and Anthropic are training AI agents to use the ordinary user interface of a website. That is, the bot would use the site just like you do, clicking and typing in a browser in a way that’s largely indistinguishable from a real person. That way, there’s no need to ask permission to use an online service through a backend – permission that could be rescinded if you’re hurting their business.\\nRabbit CEO Jesse Lyu said in a recent interview that AI agents are getting better than humans at solving CAPTCHA, the human verification tests that have previously prevented bots from shopping online. That means website owners will need to develop more sophisticated ways to prove personhood online.\\nIt’s possible that one day, AI agents could be part of a better online shopping experience than what exists today. Perplexity’s shopping agent isn’t that by a long shot, but it offers an early glimpse of what could be.\\nIn the next year, we’re likely to see better versions of AI shopping agents from Perplexity, OpenAI, and Google. We may just be seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of how this could reshape the online retail industry, and what sorts of problems AI agent developers could run into.\\nTopics\\nAI, ai agent, Fintech, online shopping, Perplexity, stripe\\nMost Popular\\nJudge confirms decision to sink Elon Musk’s $56B pay package despite Tesla shareholder vote\\nSean O'Kane\\nTesla updates include Apple Watch app and fart prank\\nRebecca Bellan\\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger retires\\nKyle Wiggers\\nThe Browser Company teases Dia, its new AI browser\\nIvan Mehta\\nAWS opens physical outlets that let customers upload their data\\nKyle Wiggers\\nAWS launches an incident response service to combat cybersecurity threats\\nKyle Wiggers\\nDeath Clock app predicts the date of your death\\nAnthony Ha\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nSenior Reporter, Consumer\\n@ZeffMax\\nMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI and emerging technologies.

(Shutterstock)\\nBy\\nBoF Insights,\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n04 December 2024\\nKey insights\\n50 percent of fashion executives see product discovery as the key use case for generative AI in 2025.\\n82 percent of customers want AI to assist in reducing the time they spend researching what to buy.\\nThe latest AI model of GPT-4o from OpenAI is 15 to 20 percent more accurate than its predecessors, exhibiting fewer hallucinations.\\nOpens in new window\\nThe volume of choice is working against fashion brands, negatively affecting conversion as shoppers increasingly abandon carts. 74 percent of customers report walking away from online purchases due to the volume of choice.\\nIn response, some retailers have reduced the size of their offering to increase relevancy and reduce choice paralysis. Asos, for example, announced it will offer fewer but more relevant brands to customers, reducing stock intake by 30 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2024, and is planning a further 16 percent reduction in stock by the end of 2024.\\nSearch remains the primary mode of online product discovery. 69 percent of customers state they go directly to a retailer’s search bar when shopping online. However, 80 percent are dissatisfied with the search experience and leave the site as a result. 41 percent cite irrelevant results as a main barrier to shopping.\\nFashion brands are starting to address the challenges by using generative AI. While promising, these efforts are a work in progress. Revolve has reported significant increases in customer engagement from its experiments with generative AI-powered search. Kering, on the other hand, introduced Madeline, a ChatGPT-powered shopping assistant, in 2023 on KNXT, a site it uses to test digital innovations, only to later disable the feature.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nIn The State of Fashion 2025, BoF and McKinsey explain how industry shifts and technology developments are set to offer customers increased curation in search and discovery in the year ahead.\\nReinventing product discovery will be a key focus area for fashion players in 2025\\nCustomer product discovery and search is the top-ranked use case for generative AI in 2025, according to fashion executives.\\nThis is thanks to a number of converging factors:\\nGrowing customer demand for AI-powered shopping experiences\\n79 percent of customers surveyed by Google say they would find it helpful for AI to understand their specific needs and recommend products. 82 percent say they want AI to reduce their time spent researching what to buy. To address this, 84 percent of organisations say hyper-personalised experiences across customer touchpoints are a priority for the next 12 months.\\nIncreased competitiveness in quality and cost\\nIntense competition among technology players such as Google, Meta and OpenAI has driven significant improvements in model quality while decreasing their cost-to-deploy. Google DeepMind’s latest AI model, Gemini, will offer AI overviews featuring refined recommendations, multi-step reasoning, planning and multi-modal capabilities. In October 2024, the company introduced a new shopping experience centred on AI features such as a personalised shopping feed and guides that summarise relevant product information. Meta has also upgraded its open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, with monthly users increasing 10x from January to July 2024.\\nGreater accuracy of AI tools\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nCompetition has also driven accuracy improvements. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4o is 15 to 20 percent more accurate than previous models, generating fewer hallucinations across a range of tasks. Similarly, start-ups such as Anthropic are entering the space with models such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, demonstrating greater accuracy compared to incumbent models.\\nEmerging commercial success stories\\nWhile experiments have produced mixed results, some brands have started to realise the impact of AI investments on product discovery and their bottom lines. Zalando credited an 18 percent year-on-year increase in profitability in the second quarter of 2024 in part to the roll-out of several generative AI features aimed at lowering costs and increasing customer engagement, including a ChatGPT-powered shopping assistant, personalised product recommendations and curated content.\\nEmerging AI challengers are redefining product search for the fashion industry\\nAI-powered shopping platforms\\nDaydream\\nBrands and retailers have recognised the power of optimising search to solve for consumers’ increasingly contextual and colloquial search terms, leveraging natural language prompts to curate a shortlist of relevant options.\\nDaydream leverages generative AI, machine learning and computer vision to deliver highly personalised search results using natural language and image recognition with detailed product catalogues. Daydream has raised $50 million in seed funding and closed partnerships with brands such as Alo Yoga, Jimmy Choo and Dôen, among others, with the objective of launching a beta version in Autumn 2024.\\nMore than 2,000\\n— \\xa0brands and retailers onboarded for Daydream’s pre-beta launch\\nCapsule\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nConsumers are using multiple modes of search, such as image recognition, to identify looks they want to shop. The likes of Google and Amazon leverage this technology, while new start-ups such as Y Combinator-backed Capsule are focusing on perfecting these alternative search methods for fashion discovery.\\nCapsule’s on-demand product discovery platform includes a unique product index, based on over 20,000 scraped data points per day. The app works similarly to the music app Shazam, using computer vision and deep learning to identify similar styles to those uploaded by users.\\n99%\\n— \\xa0of user images uploaded to Capsule in launch week matched with shoppable links\\nAI-powered discovery partners\\nConstructor\\nIncreased appetite among brands and retailers to enhance the online customer experience has sparked interest in AI partnerships with players such as Lily AI, Bloomreach, Vantage Discovery, Constructor and others.\\nConstructor’s B2B platform enables brands and retailers to embed AI in product search. Valued at $550 million, it has tripled revenues since 2022. Constructor partners with brands such as Under Armour and Birkenstock to deliver personalised search experiences and has powered more than 100 billion customer interactions in the first six months since launch.\\n20x\\n— \\xa0increase in return on investment\\nfor some brands when using Constructor’s AI product search\\nMulti-brand retailers with vast product data are driving change in content curation\\nTaobao and Tmall, Alibaba Group\\nAlibaba set up a “digital tech” firm under its e-commerce unit TTG in August 2024.\\nSearch: Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG) introduced Wenwen, a large language model chatbot that provides personalised recommendations to consumer queries using multi-modal outputs such as text, image, video and audio, and is the first fully integrated AI e-commerce user application in China. Wenwen was used more than 1.5 billion times in one month during the 11.11 shopping festival in 2023.\\nContent: The platform’s curated content and personalised short inspiration videos has improved its click-through rate.\\n30%\\n— \\xa0improvement in click-through rate with personalised content on Wenwen\\nZalando\\nZalando is investing in generative AI to become a “one-stop” destination for customers, spanning both product discovery and inspiration as well as seamless search.\\nSearch: Zalando’s AI assistant, which leverages ChatGPT technology, has been used by over 500,000 customers since its launch in 2023. It leverages data from ongoing interactions with users to refine and improve output and accuracy over time.\\nContent: Zalando Stories use generative AI to show curated content to users based on real-time data. Similarly, Trend Spotter, a B2B tool, identifies emerging trends on Zalando across six fashion capitals, enabling brands to create styles and content that resonate with real-time customer preferences.\\nOver 7M\\n— \\xa0new users since Zalando acquired lifestyle publication Highsnobiety as part of its shift towards enhanced content curation\\nSocial media will continue to change the way shoppers discover and purchase fashion\\nBrand discovery through social media is now equally as common as through search engines, with 38 percent and 37 percent of customers using the discovery methods, respectively. While in-app shopping on social media is a core part of the e-commerce market in China — short video app Douyin has a 15 percent e-commerce market share and saw total transaction volume grow by 256 percent in 2023 — social commerce has yet to pick up pace in the US and Europe.\\nHowever, social media’s growing role in discovery may finally unlock its potential in the West in 2025. The social commerce market in the US and UK is expected to almost double by 2027. This is due to:\\nPredictive algorithms: The TikTok algorithm is distinct in its focus on content discovery with the “For You” page predicting what users will enjoy based on their individual preferences, enabling them to explore new brands and products.\\nContent tools: TikTok Shop has launched a suite of generative AI creative solutions for brands to produce quality content faster, enhancing commercial prospects for brands.\\nIntegrated shopping journeys: TikTok Shop had 33 million users in the US in 2023, up 40 percent since 2022. It is estimated that approximately 43 percent of users will purchase through the platform by 2027. Following its launch on TikTok Shop, brand Princess Polly generated a 350 percent increase in purchase value and a 5x increase in purchase frequency through targeted search, with 60 percent of customers new to the brand.\\nPinterest credits its AI investments in in-app commerce for making the platform more shoppable, including features such as AI Collage, which enables shoppers to curate shoppable content. On Pinterest, posts with shoppable products are 300 percent more likely to generate engagement. It also plans to invest in a dynamic AI ad solution that will allow brands to optimise adverts in real time, prioritising users and products with the highest return.\\nHow should executives respond to these shifts?\\n1. Build AI foundations\\nEmbed AI literacy in the hiring criteria for adjacent roles, such as in marketing functions, in relation to customer experience and brand perception. Upskill the existing workforce on the appropriate use of AI.\\nEstablish a technology backbone (including tech stack and infrastructure) that provides flexibility to adopt and scale search and discovery use cases.\\nIdentify relevant tech partners for cost-effective generative AI deployment or build in-house capabilities through acquisition. Ensure product data is optimised for AI search, identifying relevant product features and attributes, for both organic search and content-led discovery.\\n2. Prioritise value and accuracy, then scale\\nApply a prioritisation framework to identify the discovery and search use cases with the highest value based on customer insights. Employ a test-and-learn approach, starting with use cases that perform specific tasks with consistently accurate results before scaling more broadly across a larger customer base or set of activities.\\nAssess on an ongoing basis the trade-offs retailers may need to make between showing customers the most relevant products to improve conversion and monetising search results by allowing brands to sponsor listings.\\n3. Manage risks and ethics\\nImplement AI best practice frameworks to guide teams through the appropriate use and communication of AI in content and search to gain customer trust.\\nConsistently monitor how AI models are developed and trained, incorporating broader data sets that consider all customers. Monitor search accuracy and model output through human validation and A/B testing to ensure resonance with customers. Balance changes with brand tone of voice, prioritising authenticity and avoiding rigid algorithm-driven outputs.\\nThis article first appeared in The State of Fashion 2025, an in-depth report on the global fashion industry, co-published by BoF and McKinsey & Company.\\nSee all comments\\nFurther Reading\\nThe State of Fashion 2025: Challenges at Every Turn\\nThe ninth annual State of Fashion report by McKinsey & Company and BoF Insights, The Business of Fashion’s data and advisory team, reveals that economic and geopolitical challenges, combined with shifts in customer values, will define a turbulent year ahead.

Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every week.\\nThe holiday spending season is officially here. Shoppers are tapping mobile phones, typing on keyboards, and yes, even going into actual stores in search of gifts to make the darkest part of the year more festive.\\nWhile today’s shopping event—Cyber Monday—is really just a name for sales, it’s still enormous. (According to the Pew Research Center, 96% of adults use the internet and 79% have a high-speed connection at home—a vast difference from the 2005 origin of the event, when people used their work computers to shop online.) CapitalOne predicts that holiday shoppers will spend $13.2 billion today. In 2023, 94 million people shopped online on Cyber Monday, which was a 26.5% bigger shopping day than Black Friday.\\nSince the holiday spending season brings so much business—according to the National Retail Foundation, it’s driven an average of 19% of total annual sales for the last five years for retailers—we’re devoting Forbes CEO today to what retailers and shipping companies call the most wonderful time of the year. We’ve got statistics and projections about what consumers are likely to spend and how it can impact the economy. I also talked to Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, about how Google’s AI is impacting e-commerce this holiday season.\\nThanks so much for reading, and may your registers ring.\\nSPENDING PROJECTIONS\\ngetty\\nIt’s high shopping season now, but the projections about how people were likely to spend have been coming out since August. The good news: All predictions have shown more spending this year. The not-so-great news: Many see slower growth than in the past.\\nAccording to the National Retail Federation’s annual holiday sales predictions in October, total retail sales are expected to increase 2.5% to 3.5% over 2023 levels. Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon wrote this is a modest increase but still would be a spending record, with shoppers expected to spend at least $25 billion more than last year. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said retailers are fairly upbeat and optimistic about the holidays, even though they’re concerned that shoppers will be more price-conscious.\\nDeloitte made a similar projection in September, expecting holiday spending to increase between 2.3% and 3.3%. Michael Jeschke, leader of Deloitte’s Retail & Consumer Products Practice, told Verdon in an interview about this forecast that they see a “return to normal spending” in 2024—more in line with the last 10 to 15 years in terms of growth than the previous three, which were all deeply impacted by the pandemic and its after effects. But still, Deloitte found that consumers plan to spend an average of $1,778 this holiday season—8% more than 2023—with the largest increases on experiences, decor and holiday clothing.\\nIn August, Salesforce predicted online global holiday sales of $1.19 trillion, growth of just 2% from 2023’s $1.17 trillion, wrote Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon. Adobe’s online forecast, made about a month later in September, predicts a record $240.8 billion in online spending in the U.S., an increase of 8.4% over 2023, Verdon wrote in another article. Patrick Brown, Adobe’s vice president of growth marketing and insights, told Verdon that they anticipate consumers to do more splurging on bigger ticket items—and more deep discounts coming on them this year.\\nThe spending got off to a rousing start last week. Black Friday online sales approached $11 billion—an increase of more than 10%, Verdon reported from Adobe Analytics and Salesforce data. But there was a loser on Black Friday: actual stores. There was an 8.2% drop in in-store traffic, according to Sensormatic Solutions. Grant Gustafson, Sensormatic’s head of retail and analytics, told Verdon this was likely caused by retailers improving their online shopping experiences and spreading sales to the entire week.\\nECONOMIC INDICATORS\\ngetty\\nWhile analysts predict that more money will be spent this year, consumers have also borne the brunt of inflation for the last several years. Prices of most items, from food and fuel to gifts and experiences, are still a little more expensive—something that could make a big difference in what people spend.\\nForbes senior contributor Sharon Edelson reported on a survey from ESW at the beginning of October that found 61% of consumers said they planned to spend more than $600 this holiday season, but 47% said the high prices of food and fuel will lead them to spend less than they would otherwise.\\nSalesforce predicted back in August that value will be top-of-mind for consumers this year, with one in five online purchases expected to be made on a Chinese-headquartered shopping app: namely Temu, Shein and TikTok. In August, 63% of consumers had made purchases from one of these apps during the previous six months, and half had already planned to buy from them during the holiday season. Salesforce said TikTok was likely to be the big winner; its customer base increased 24% between April and August.\\nDeloitte’s Jeschke said in September that inflation is likely to have both a positive and negative impact on holiday spending. With decreased inflation comes an ability to spend more, but the prolonged period of inflation has eaten into many households’ savings, which could lead to more credit card debt.\\nAn overwhelming majority of consumers—85.1%—said they expect to use credit or borrowing to make holiday purchases, according to Coresight Research’s Holiday 2024 Consumer Survey and Retail Outlook, Verdon wrote last month. Four in 10 expect to put the majority of their spending on credit, and more than a third are using credit cards more than last year, according to Salesforce.\\nTOMORROW’S TRENDS\\nHow Google’s AI Is Shifting The Holiday E-Commerce Playing Field\\nBrightEdge Founder and CEO Jim Yu.\\nBrightEdge, Sopa Images/Lightrocket via Getty Images\\nIt’s hard to miss the changes that Google has been making to its search results pages this year, especially when it comes to shopping. As the tech giant continues to improve its AI-powered search results, it’s doing more to impact what it shows to consumers. I talked to Jim Yu, CEO of SEO and content marketing firm BrightEdge, which keeps close tabs on what Google and other search engines are doing. I spoke to him about some of the changes and what they mean for businesses. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\\nWhat are some new things Google is incorporating in its e-commerce search results?\\nYu: Google’s doing a lot in some of these commerce shopping queries [with] experimentation around YouTube. It makes sense if you think about multimodal content. If you are shopping for the new Sonos, buying a new iPhone or looking for a big screen TV, a lot of times people go to YouTube and find reviews. But it takes a lot of time to watch those videos.\\nGoogle’s AI overview automatically goes and looks at the video, watches the video, transcribes the video, then figures out what query is relevant for in search and summarizes. For example, if there are some pros and cons to buying something, it automatically looks at the video, along with regular reviews, and then summarizes that into the AI overview.\\nThis is a very interesting hint into the future of AI. The last 18 months has been around large language models, which have been about just text. From a shopper perspective during the holiday season, you don’t have to watch all that stuff and spend a ton of time researching.\\nIs it doing a good job of picking credible reviews? I mean, anybody who wants to do a product review can, but I imagine that an editor at Consumer Reports' review might carry more weight than one from my neighbor.\\nI think they’re doing a relatively good job with this. It’s an interesting dynamic because on YouTube they have a lot more signals around content moderation. Bigger picture, you saw this evolution with AI overviews, where in the beginning it was using a lot of Reddit and Quora content—user-generated, creator-generated content, but with maybe less on moderation and authority. With YouTube, there are better controls and guardrails around the authority they ascribe to a creator.\\nWhat else has Google changed and added for the shopping season in terms of AI and search results?\\nThere are larger AI overview panels. And by larger, I mean the real estate the AI overview takes now. We have not seen a lot of ads appear. I know they're talking about that, [and because] the space that the AI overview is taking is increasing, that may be a precursor to having more real estate to add ads into that format.\\nYou’re seeing more of the introduction of AI overviews at the top of search results, and a lot of times, integrating more details around the product so it’s a richer experience if you have a high-intent shopping query.\\nThe product carousel, where in the AI overviews you can actually see different products, went up 300%. It’s not just describing products, describing attributes to consider, talking about the latest trends and things like that, but [it can] go ahead and show you the products that you can click through and buy. Those are going to be very important aspects heading into the holiday season.\\nWhat does this mean for CMOs and CEOs?\\nYou’ve got to start analyzing this. If Google is important to your business, which for many people it is, especially as you head into the holiday shopping season, make sure you understand and monitor where AI is showing up in your portfolio of shopping keywords. If you have products [that would be in its] carousels, make sure that the product feeds you’re sending Google are in there, they’re timely, accurate and optimized because it’s pulling that right into the front of the AI. You want your image of your product and the information from your products to show up in that AI overview. And the best chance of that is making sure that you are feeding that directly into Google.\\nYou also want to make sure you are very focused on the quality of the data and the content that you’re sending. Before, nobody was going to page two of the results. Now, you really want to be the trusted, accurate information that’s right in the AI portion at the top of that page.\\nOne other thing I would [recommend], especially for shopping, is visual content. The trend here, especially in commerce, is people don’t just shop by looking at words. People are looking at pictures and videos and things like that. You want to make sure you are the source of that beautiful picture of that product and that is going to be another important element of winning in the AI-assisted shopping experience.\\nVIDEO\\nQUIZ\\nApple released an emotional holiday ad over Thanksgiving. What is it about?\\nA. A profoundly shy man using Apple Intelligence to get ideas to strike up a conversation with the co-worker he has had his eye on, finally asking her out at a holiday party\\nB.

Mixed.\\n“Very, very few companies are nailing it,” Homkes said. “There’s no such thing as an AI strategy. This is what’s holding a bunch of companies back. They’re trying to develop the perfect AI strategy and there’s no such thing. The role of AI is to enable support and accelerate your value-creating strategy. So if you are confused on value creation … AI cannot help you this holiday season.”\\nFor companies that do have a handle on their customer and how they go to market with their value proposition, Homkes said AI can work some magic.\\n“The best AI is personalized, it’s customized,” she said. “It says, ‘Hey, I know you as a shopper, I know what you want in your cart,’ and ‘Hey, you might’ve missed something in your cart.’ That’s where we’re seeing some brands make some progress, but it’s choppy. It’s a little bit haphazard still.”\\nHomkes said executives are taking AI seriously and are using it to help workers be more productive while moving toward a footing that will let AI help transform processes or invent new ones.\\nThat’s the next turn of the wheel.\\nIn the meantime, people are getting smarter along with their machines.\\n“One of the most powerful things AI can do is shorten learning time, which brings more agility, which brings more value creation, which brings more growth,” she said. “And the organizations that are using it for that are the ones who are getting the bigger unlocks.”\\nThe world is still very much on the steep part of the AI learning curve.\\nEven Amazon, which rolled out a bunch of new initiatives in the area this week, including a big new supercomputer, is still working on figuring things out.\\n“We have a new shopping assistant called Rufus,” said Jenny Freshwater, leader of the Amazon Fashion business, in a Cyber Monday interview. “You can get to it through the colorful bubbles at the bottom of the app, and you can type in any question like, ‘gift idea for a 17-year-old who likes sports’ and it’ll come back with shopping guides.”\\nRufus launched earlier this year and is already fielding millions of questions each week, getting better along the way.\\n“We’ll learn a lot through this holiday period,” Freshwater said of Rufus. “We didn’t have it last year. The holiday period is always different in terms of how customers think and shop. And so I think we’re going to learn a ton more.”\\nMany retailers that don’t have the tech savvy of Amazon might well learn that they don’t have the systems and structures to make any light-speed jumps into the future.\\nChad Shuford, a partner at the Silicon Foundry advisory firm, said, “While this season serves as a pivotal testing ground for enterprise AI tools, their material impact remains uneven as retailers contend with data silos, operational complexities, and the challenge of delivering real-time, scalable personalization.”\\nBut the breadth of AI activity in retail is just boggling.\\nShuford pointed to retail efforts to get smarter with real-time inventory management, predictive analytics, personalized marketing, product recommendations, dynamic pricing and promotions.\\nAnd there’s plenty more AI in the works, from distribution centers to home offices.\\nAlready it’s doing what could be considered very human work, churning out advertising copy and standing in as virtual fashion models.\\nBarcelona-based Mango caused a stir in July with an advertising campaign that was generated entirely using AI tools although the company’s design, art and styling and photography departments all worked on the campaign.\\nJordi Alex, chief information technology officer at Mango, said at the time: “Artificial intelligence is a technological revolution that presents great opportunities that should act as a co-pilot to extend the capabilities of our employees and further amplify our creativity. Because technology will either make us more human or it won’t.”\\nThe many qualms and worries about AI will have to be addressed sooner rather than later as it is a peculiarly useful technology that is now out in the wild.\\nUnlike the metaverse, which is simmering on the back burner, AI has broad-based, real world appeal now to businesses and is growing everywhere and all at once.\\xa0So as Nike’s digital sneaker unit Rtfkt winds down and evolves into “an artifact of cultural revolution,” AI is starting to hit its stride.\\nAside from Amazon, the retail-cum-tech giant Walmart is probably best positioned to take advantage of the moment given its scale, resources and inclination to lean in.\\nThe discount retailer, for instance, has had its own personal shopping assistant in beta for about five months.\\n“We’re seeing early tangible results from the deployment of generative AI,” Walmart chief executive officer Doug McMillon crowed to investors last month.\\n“I’m a little hesitant to talk about AI, because I know someone will hear this in the months and years to come and chuckle about how old school it sounds, given how fast things are changing,” McMillon said. “But it’s important to convey that we’re learning and applying generative AI, AI and machine learning to solve the practical opportunities right in front of us.\\n“Our data sets are valuable, and we’re learning to put them to work to improve the customer and member experience and assist our associates as they do their daily work,” he said. “We’re racing to improve all the things that people love about shopping and remove or diminish all the things they don’t.”\\nThat’s a big goal, really the standing order for retailers everywhere. Maybe fashion can get a little closer to it with some high-tech help, assuming the robots don’t take over.\\nThe Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

The analysts who authored the reports also offered retailers and brands strategies to mitigate economic disruptions.\\nSimilar to other research reports that have been issued over the past month, these two recent ones point to the need to invest in technology and to focus on creating a more agile supply chain as a way to mitigate market disruptions.\\nAnjee Solanki, national director of retail services and practice groups at Colliers, the global real estate firm, said in her outlook report that as 2025 approaches, “the retail industry is navigating a complex landscape characterized by both growth opportunities and uncertainties.”\\nYou May Also Like\\nRelated Articles\\nRetail\\nBalzac Paris Opens in the Marais as Digital Native Brand Expands Retail\\nMens Retail Business\\nEXCLUSIVE: Menswear Label Le Père Opens West Coast Flagship\\nSolanki said the challenges include rising costs, evolving technological demands and geopolitical instability, “all while adapting to continuously shifting consumer behaviors and economic conditions.” She said retailers are focusing on strengthening their supply chains to be more flexible and transparent. “This includes using blockchain technology for better traceability and creating local manufacturing models to respond quickly to market changes,” Solanki said. “Despite tempered consumer optimism, advancements in technology and strategic operational adjustments are enabling retailers to remain resilient.”\\nThe analyst said that while many retail segments are optimistic about overall growth, mass retailers and home goods merchants are more pessimistic. “This measured optimism stems from the ongoing hurdles affecting new development,” Solanki explained. “By the close of 2024, approximately 50 million square feet of new shopping center space will have been added in the U.S., an increase from 35 million in 2023, but still below the historical average of 61 million square feet per year from 2008 to 2020.”\\nShe said high construction costs (stuck at 30 to 40 percent above pre-pandemic levels) make it difficult for projects to be financially viable — even in strong markets. “Rising labor and material expenses and overstretched project budgets impact profit margins,” Solanki said. “Even in markets with strong demand, these elevated costs can erode returns, making it harder for developers to justify new investments.”\\nFrom a broader economic perspective, Solanki said retail sales have remained in positive territory since at least 2020, “but the recent wave of inflation and subsequent tightening of monetary policies have started to take their toll.”\\nLast year retail spending growth was 3.4 percent, but will likely slow to 3.2 percent this year and then drop to 3.1 percent in 2025. “This gradual slowdown reflects a stabilizing retail landscape following the post-pandemic consumer activity surge, fueled by pent-up demand and unprecedented spending levels,” Solanki said. “Despite moderating inflation, consumers are becoming more selective in their purchases. This shift signals a move toward a more sustainable pace of growth, marked by cautious consumer behavior, more balanced supply chains and market dynamics that prioritize essential and value-oriented spending over discretionary items.”\\nDavid Barker, president of productivity solutions and services at Honeywell, said in his 2025 outlook report that AI is an industry game-changer and can help offset a host of challenges. “With AI increasingly moving from the back of the store to front-and-center, the technology is transforming retail operations, accelerating supply chains and impacting the customer experience, making holiday shopping smoother in-store and online,” he said.\\nFor 2025, Barker sees a mandate for agile supply chains. “The most successful retailers will be those with agile supply chains capable of responding instantly to shifting market trends, seasonal demands and unforeseen disruptions,” he said. “Leveraging advancements in real-time data and AI-driven decision-making, these companies will seamlessly pivot between suppliers and logistics providers, effectively sidestepping bottlenecks, shortages and delays. This flexibility will no longer be a competitive advantage but a necessity for staying relevant in an increasingly dynamic market.”\\nBarker also sees AI playing a key role in retail success by empowering sales associates. “With fierce competition for labor and high expectations for customer service, retailers will increasingly look to technologies to make associates’ jobs easier that can enable them to serve customers most efficiently,” he noted. “Innovative solutions like augmented reality-enabled devices and AI-powered digital resources will empower workers to quickly answer shopper questions and find inventory easily.”\\nBarker said these technologies “will help meet evolving customer needs in a highly competitive market, reduce the time it takes for employees to get up-to-speed on the job and streamline operations.”\\nTags\\nbusiness operations\\nconsumer spending\\nretail\\nNewslettersSign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day\\nSign up\\nWWD Recommends\\nPrincess Charlene of Monaco Puts an Edgy Twist on a Winter Vest at the Inauguration of Christmas Lights in Monte-Carlo\\nCelebrity News\\nBy\\nMarissa Muller\\n‘The Devil Wears Prada: The Musical’ Red Carpet Premiere: Lily Collins, Elizabeth Hurley, and More Star Style [Photos]\\nCelebrity News\\nBy\\nMarissa Muller\\nTiffany Haddish and Kathy Bates Favor Monochrome Hues at Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards Gala\\nCelebrity News\\nBy\\nHannah Malach\\nAnya Taylor-Joy’s Dream Role Involves a ‘Giant Bowl of\\xa0Sugar’\\nMost Popular\\n### See Miss Universe 2024 Runner-Up Miss Nigeria Chidimma Adetshina\\'s Winning Looks: Evening Gown, Swimwear and More\\n### Princess Charlene of Monaco Puts an Edgy Twist on a Winter Vest at…\\n### Club Ciné Is Making Film Clubs Trendy Again\\n### Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Ushers in New Era of Athletic and…\\n### Pendleton to Offer First Swim, Beachwear Collection\\nWWDGet all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.\\nEnter your Email\\nSign Up Sign Up\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Scott Raynovich is the Founder and Chief Analyst at Futuriom.com\\nFollowing\\nDec 6, 2024,01:43pm EST\\nShare to Facebook\\nShare to Twitter\\nShare to Linkedin\\nThis year’s Amazon Web Services conference, re:Invent 2024, confirmed a few trends we’ve been tracking in the artificial intelligence boom. These include massive changes in the cloud infrastructure landscape with investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in an AI infrastructure arms race, as well as the struggle of enterprises to find return on investment in AI.\\nThis week, both of these trends had interesting twists. The week started off with the resignation of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, demonstrating what happens when you miss a huge market shift. Intel, even before Gelsinger took over, was poorly positioned in graphics processing units, the area that NVIDIA pioneered. But Gelsinger perhaps made things worse by focusing on an approach favoring the buildout of domestic and European manufacturing facilities and a foundry business, all based in part on government funding.\\nAWS had plenty of announcements in hardware to demonstrate that it will stay in front of the AI arms race, including ensuring its supply of chips. In addition to buying chips from AI compute leaders NVIDIA and AMD, AWS has its own line of chips, including Graviton and Trainium. Here at re:Invent, it unveiled mass-scale AI clusters, complete with its own networking and interconnect technology, as well as general availability of its Trainium2 AI training chip.\\nLAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman delivers a keynote address ... [+] during AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services)\\nGetty Images for Amazon Web Services\\nOn the enterprise ROI front, I saw several examples of this in the re:Invent keynotes as well as the analyst conference, where companies as diverse as Apple, JP Morgan, The Hartford, Novo Nordisk, and others demonstrated how they are using AI to gain ROI in specific use cases.\\nLet’s dive into these two areas in more detail.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### FBI Warns iPhone And Android Users—Stop Sending Texts\\n### FBI Warns Smartphone Users—Hang Up And Create A Secret Word Now\\n### Gmail Takeover Hack Attack—Google Warns You Have Just 7 Days To Act\\nAmazon Shows It’s Still King of the Cloud\\nWalking around the re:Invent conference, which hosted 60,000 people, you can talk to anybody from cloud engineers to Fortune 500 CEOs. The conference is of course owned and operated by AWS, so it’s an annual tradition for AWS to launch a barrage of technology announcements—literally hundreds—that demonstrate why it’s still the leading cloud operator.\\nThe question is, will AI help or hurt AWS in the long run? In addition to AWS competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, the AI boom has spawned a raft of AI-focused cloud providers, including Lambda and CoreWeave, the latter of which has achieved a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in just a few years.\\nAWS is of course determined not to let AI derail its leadership. Its announcements range from huge hardware projects to feature upgrades of its AI services SageMaker and Bedrock.\\nOn the hardware front, AWS showed it has a diversification strategy to provide its own hardware, even though it buys from many suppliers, including NVIDIA. AWS announced general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) on Trn2 instances, which feature clusters of 16 Trn2 chips. And Trn2 can be scaled up using hardware clustering solutions. A separate Trn2 UltraServer, now in preview, features a cluster of 64 Trn2 chips across four Trn2 instances.\\nAWS CEO Matt Garman positioned it as a broadening of the market rather than as a competitive alternative to NVIDIA.\\n\"NVIDIA is an incredibly important partner of ours. AMD is an incredible partner as well. Today it is true that the vast majority of workloads run on NVIDIA. We\\'re so early where GenAI can be, that I think Trainium increases the size of the pie. It\\'s not going to be at the expense [of others].\"\\nThe company is also planning a massive supercomputer named Project Rainier in partnership with Anthropic (which AWS has invested in), based on UltraServers. It\\'s set to debut in 2025. Anthropic isn’t alone. Other Trn2 customers include Databricks, Datadog, Ricoh, Hugging Face, and PyTorch.\\nAI Feature Upgrades\\nIt wouldn’t be re:Invent without lots of geeky upgrades to AWS services. AWS has rebranded its SageMaker ML service as SageMaker AI, which sports a bunch of enhancements designed to grease the wheels of ML-based analytics. These include the SageMaker HyperPod, which coordinates modeling workloads.\\nIn a keynote talk at the conference this week, Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of AI and data at AWS, outlined a raft of new services that streamline model training and inferencing for enterprise customers.\\n“We’re seeing the convergence of big data, analytics, machine learning, and generative AI,” said Sivasubramanian. And AWS has built on a range of past successes to meet demand, he said.\\nIn another example, the company’s other AI service, Bedrock, offers a range of large language models. This year features multi-agent collaboration, which allows agents to coordinate across different tasks. Example: For a financial services firm, according to AWS’s online announcement, “specialized agents could coordinate to gather data, analyze trends, and provide actionable recommendations—working in parallel to improve response times and precision.” This feature is currently available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland) AWS Regions.\\nThe Enterprise AI Question\\nQueue up the next topic: enterprise AI. The world is filled with chatter about whether AI can fulfill its promise in delivering ROI to the enterprise.\\nThere are of course many skeptics, including Render founder and CEO Anurag Goel, who was also a former executive at Stripe. Render has a cloud automation platform that Goel says is being adopted by “hundreds of thousands of developers per month.” He told me that he hadn’t seen a huge demonstration of ROI at the conference.\\n“AWS announced a lot of services around AI but they lack a coherent end-to-end theme,” Goel told me in the hallway of the Venetian. “The business value and the ROI remains unclear.”\\nDespite some skepticism about the AI endgame, some attendees said there has been a shift in thinking from “god” products to more tactical technology using AI. Adam Jacob, cofounder and CEO of System Initiative, told me the new thinking embodies a more tactical, focused approach he refers to as “micro AI.”\\n“As an industry, we started out by thinking, ‘We\\'re going to have a single god robot that we just pump all the exabytes of data to and we just let the god machine sort it out.’ We\\'re learning that that creates a terrible user experience and is incredibly hard to track and secure. Instead, we\\'re starting to build micro AI experiences that form a series of small experiences that build up to really compelling big ones.\"\\nThe case for micro AI makes sense. Generalized AI is difficult and has key challenges such as accuracy, data security, and data provenance. But if you can focus on specific solutions with an AI tool, you might have a better shot at ROI gratification.\\nIn its analyst conference, AWS did a good job of presenting ROI examples from customers, which was a noticeable change from last year, when the market was still riding the pink cloud of AI hype.\\nIn its briefing sessions for industry analysts, AWS had examples of compelling ROI-driven case studies.

[+] investments.\\ngetty\\nAI-based agents are very much having a moment right now. In recent months the topic has been pervasive across the events and marketing of many tech vendors, including Salesforce, Microsoft, ServiceNow, SAP, Amazon Web Services and Google. In many ways, the broad coverage and the promises about business impact are warranted: Agents represent the next evolution of generative AI capabilities and enable a more autonomous AI experience. Instead of just answering questions like AI chatbots do, agents can have tasks delegated to them by people or even other agents. It’s an exciting advance in AI technology, which is why I started writing about agents and their potential. And just like almost every aspect of AI, the technology is moving fast.\\nWhen I wrote my initial article on AI agents two months ago, the news cycle and product announcements were heavily focused on agents deployed within application platforms—with Salesforce serving as a key example. The purpose of these agents is to enable personal productivity and task automation within the context of the platform. So, for instance, consider a personal productivity agent that periodically scans multiple documents, summarizes the information in them and recommends actions to an end user. To stick with the Salesforce example, that might mean a quarterly scan of the prospect pipeline to see if there are new digital marketing opportunities and provide suggestions for tactics. These personal productivity agents provide some very helpful benefits to end users looking to get more done, more quickly.\\nThe Trouble With Personal Productivity Agents\\nThe problem is that while personal productivity agents are helpful, they are not always impactful. Personal productivity agents deployed in application platforms have been great in the sense that they have shown the overall potential of agents by leveling up an existing technology investment. And over time a percentage of these new agents are sure to deepen the connection between the users and the platform. But true business impact will be measured when a business sees a clear return on investment and spends net-new money on it, versus using something that’s included for free (or “free”) or that’s available for a slight incremental increase in price. And, sadly, I think personal productivity agents will not achieve that status, for three reasons.\\nUsage across teams drives business impact — It’s a good thing when a single employee finds a better way to do their job. But the biggest improvements come when that employee can reach out to other team members—and other functional groups—to improve an entire process. To put it another way, one or two developers writing code faster is nice, but it’s not likely to move up an application’s ship date.\\nPersonal productivity improvements do not increase the number of power users or super users — While AI has great potential, we have seen other technical breakthroughs in personal productivity applications languish in the field. Everyone has had a spreadsheet application on their desktops for decades. Yet despite all of the improvements in spreadsheets over the years, has the ratio of power users to total users changed? The answer seems to be no. And I say “seems” since there is no clear way to define a power user and quantify their impact.\\nPersonal tool-making technology is hard for IT to manage and govern — Over the years, increased personal productivity has been a benefit created by many tools. And vendors of technologies such as low- and no-code tools have touted the idea of individual empowerment by enabling people to make their own tools. While there are notable examples of this working for the individual, these tools also create many IT issues. Application sprawl, where many people create many apps that do sort of the same thing, is one key example. Another one is abandonment, where apps are just forgotten about and not used. The cost, governance and security issues created by these platforms can be a challenge for strapped IT teams.\\nImpactful Agents Will Be Enterprise-Focused\\nAgain, personal productivity agents do have utility, but the generative AI ecosystems still need to provide more measurable business value to justify strategic investments. We are starting to see signs that this is a possibility. For example, I recently covered UiPath and how it is approaching enterprise agentic development to accompany its robotic process automation solution, ideally leading to more efficient business processes. By taking a different approach to governance and agentic development, UiPath provides more breadth in building cross-enterprise agentic applications.\\nIn a slightly different context, consulting firms such as IBM are retooling how they deliver enterprise systems integration projects using their own enterprise-wide agent factories to reduce time-to-delivery and increase project quality. In researching these and other companies working on enterprise AI agents, I’ve found that, although the technology is different, the implementation still rests upon sound IT practices developed over the past 40 years. The key practices are:\\nStart with a meaningful cross-functional business problem — This means that the project needs to have at least one business metric that it impacts, for example deploying a technology that increases revenue yield without increasing the number of salespeople.\\nPlace a high priority on change management — While there is no measure of the ratio of power users to all users, most IT executives say that fewer than 20% of users are power users. Therefore, introducing any technology advancement must either be invisible to average end users or have sufficient change management applied such that it is adopted widely. For example, it’s possible that agents may be very helpful in providing inline assistance for average users thanks to the core capabilities of large language models—and that they will be adopted widely for this reason.\\nLeverage a solid technology foundation — Achieving success requires a solid set of technologies to build upon. Agentic applications touch a lot of diverse data, so ensuring that the data is well secured is critical. Over time, infrastructure in the form of reliable compute and storage is also important, especially as you scale the application across the enterprise.\\nDeliver with a well-thought-out framework — For a project to be deemed successful, you need a set of clear goals to measure against throughout the project lifecycle. Those goals and measures should come from a project framework that is either internally developed or produced by a reputable third party. In addition to solutions such as Consulting Advantage from IBM, startups such as Zavvis are automating common functional roles (in Zavvis’s case, the CFO’s) as the framework.\\nMake it sticky and usable for years to come — Big-bang projects are a temporary salve for older harmful practices. Instead of focusing on solving for today’s issues, design the solution such that it can become a new operational process delivering value and preventing the risk of needing another big-bang project.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### When Is Spotify Wrapped 2024 Coming Out? Here’s The Likely Release Date\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### Samsung Warning—Do Not Install These Apps On Your Galaxy S24 Or S23\\nAI ROI = Enterprise Agents + Established IT Practices\\nAgain, I am not trying to talk down about the first round of productivity agents. They do serve a purpose and honestly are a very good way to get stakeholders comfortable with AI. But when it comes to a leadership team making a real bet on a new technology I think the bar is—and should be—a bit higher.\\nThe good news is that we are starting to see meaningful efforts from multiple cloud, enterprise and startup technology vendors. And in some cases we are also seeing these new AI agentic technologies being leveraged to accelerate aspects of the implementation. That said, while technology speeds some things up, we are also seeing that the process to get there remains very similar to the well-worn path of enterprise technology adoption.\\nIn my next piece I’ll dig into some fresh examples of IT offerings coming into the marketplace that aim to achieve broader business results using agentic applications.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

Sales and marketing leaders who act decisively and strategically will come out on top.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nAdobeStock_185811951\\nAs generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) quickly becomes a critical component across multiple industries in everything from content creation and product development to improving employee productivity, its use as a tool in sales and marketing to automate manual processes and personalize customer interactions is beginning to emerge. Which means one thing: It’s time to get moving—now—on using AI to enhance go-to-market (GTM) strategies.\\nAdoption is in the early stages, but that’s no time to be caught napping, especially considering how AI can make a difference, and how quickly competitors will take advantage of its power. Sales and marketing leaders have seen this pattern before, from the early days of the internet and e-commerce to the introduction of mobile communications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and the use of social media. Organizations that moved quickly to embrace the “next big thing” surged ahead of the pack, finding innovative ways to disrupt the market and turn things to their advantage.\\nIn fact, companies are already embracing GenAI to drive greater productivity and efficiency across key marketing and sales disciplines. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 49% of senior managers are using GenAI to complete research and report summaries for important projects while 24% are using it to boost customer support and answer frequently asked questions from prospects and customers.\\nProsper - What You Use Generative AI For\\nProsper Insights & Analytics\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### Major Cucumber Recall Expands To 35 States Over Salmonella Concerns—68 Illnesses Reported So Far\\n### A Highway Of Death In Kursk Just Got Even Deadlier For Russian Forces\\nA new report from Marketbridge, which queried C-Suite leaders and go-to-market decision makers from leading technology organizations (including hardware, software, networking and security organizations) across sales, marketing, strategy and customer success functions revealed that 66% of senior executives from large $1B+ technology organizations believe AI disruption will help nimble startups and emerging competitors rapidly evolve their product portfolios.\\n“AI is changing the game in how technology leaders bring products to market quickly and decisively,” said Honeywell CMO Ron McMurtrie. “AI has not only impacted product development, but it has evolved our GTM models, which will allow us to release new innovations faster and more meaningfully than ever before.”\\nAs GenAI emerges as a transformational technology for sales and marketing leaders, there are two major changes underway. The first involves how work gets completed within go-to-market teams especially as a significant amount of research and tactical execution can be automated by AI. The second one represents a seismic shift in how these leaders sell technology solutions to brand new buyers as they rethink which markets they pursue and how they best approach them.\\nGenAI Use Is Accelerating\\nTransformational technologies enter the market through a series of well-defined phases. GenAI, which has proliferated since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, is at the tail end of the “initial disruption” phase, when organizations are running pilots and using AI in specific areas. C-Suite leaders from leading technology companies are moving beyond that phase and implementing AI to drive GTM strategies in the following ways based on finding from the Marketbridge study:\\n57% of C-Suite executives believe that AI will disrupt how they structure their organization to capitalize on new opportunities while 53% state it will change how they innovate their product portfolio mix to meet customer needs and 58% relay it will evolve how they explore new business model opportunitie\\n52% will use AI to deploy marketing and sales resources more cost-effectively to align with buyer needs and capture new market opportunities, leveraging AI to position solutions in a personalized, relevant way at scale.\\n46% see the greatest value creation coming from analyzing vast amounts of data to optimize performance and return on GTM investment.\\n“The broad accessibility of AI means that the time it takes organizations to settle on their AI use plus test and discover which new GTM models will deliver growth will depend upon their size, with smaller more nimble firms likely to experience benefit first,” said Valoir CEO and Principal Analyst Rebecca Wettemann. The Marketbridge study found that large companies (with more than $1 billion in revenue) expect the shakeout to take five to 10 years, while smaller companies (less than $1 billion) expect a more rapid progression, with the market stabilizing in less than two years.\\nHarnessing the Power of GenAI\\nGrowth leaders can start by planning for differentiation, identifying and investing in solutions that will set their GTM strategies apart. And it’s important to think big: A market shakeout is a land grab in which there is strength in numbers, so find ways to expand your customer base and strengthen your AI differentiation, optimizing support strategies alongside partners with AI insights designed to boost growth and profitability.\\nExecuting clear strategies can put growth leaders and their organizations in a position to leverage GenAI to not only enhance efficiency, but also to create and nurture deeper connections with customers to generate incremental revenue growth. According to Marketbridge, putting GenAI to effective use in your organization involves several key steps:\\nIdentify Areas of Emerging Growth. The increased demand for AI-enabled solutions creates opportunities for new revenue streams. It’s critical for GTM leaders to identify areas with the most potential for growth and invest accordingly.\\nRecognize Changing Buyer Needs. As buyer behavior shifts, closely track changes in that behavior to guide strategies around customer targeting, promotion timing, support tactics and more.\\nReinvent New Routes to Market. Disruptive technology like AI will create new expectations from customers about how they want to engage with vendors. Organizations will need to rethink their strategies to meet those expectations and optimize their distribution channels.\\nReimagine the Jobs AI Won’t Do. With AI handling routine tasks, teams can refocus on higher-value activities that drive growth, encouraging a more strategic use of human resources. Successful companies will identify jobs with the highest potential and redesign AI-enabled workflows to support them.\\nTake a Unique Approach to AI Solutions. It’s not enough to offer innovative AI solutions. To stand out in a crowded marketplace, companies must match their unique value propositions with AI, making it clear how they differ from competitors. That enables crisp positioning that makes the value clear to your audiences.\\nActivate New High-Performing Sales Motions. Effective activation is the key to driving value from new AI strategies. Marketing and sales leaders will need to work together on creating demand generation campaigns, account-based marketing (ABM) programs and sales motions to build the pipeline.\\nAs the market proceeds through the AI adoption cycle, the integration of GenAI into sales and marketing strategies creates an opportunity for innovation and growth for early adopters – and an existential threat to organizations that lag. GTM leaders should immediately begin working to understand, develop and leverage GenAI strategies. Waiting will only put you behind the curve as early adopters refine and hone their own strategies.\\nAs with disruptive technologies of the past, forward-thinking leaders who act quickly will not only navigate the current disruptions, but they will also position their organizations to thrive in the future. This requires a commitment to understanding new capabilities, an openness to reimagining traditional practices and the flexibility to put changes into play. As the market evolves, those who act decisively and strategically will emerge as leaders in the new era of AI-enabled sales and marketing.\\nCheck out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nGary Drenik\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

[+] re:Invent 2024, hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian December 3, 2024. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services)\\nGetty Images for Amazon Web Services\\nThere is no shortage of announcements and talks at AWS’s re:Invent conference here in Vegas this week—from AWS CEO Matt Garman and President & CEO of Amazon (AMZN) Andy Jassy to partners like Apple (AAPL).\\nLast month I wrote about how artificial intelligence (AI) will redefine our workplaces at scale; and last week Salesforce Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff penned an essay in TIME on how agentic AI can deliver unlimited digital labor that will upend industries, societies and GDP.\\nAgentic AI is becoming a force-multiplier that can tie the various threads of AI together and turn “workplace transformation” from consulting-speak into operational realities for your company. Let’s unpack agentic AI’s market traction, how it can help deliver on the promise, and new capabilities that C-suite leaders can look to for help.\\nAI Agents (Suggesting) Vs. Agentic AI (Acting)\\nThe phrase “agentic AI” has received a lot of attention from technologists, analysts, and enterprises, leaving some to wonder what all the excitement is about. Discerning human agents from AI agents and agentic AI can understandably be confusing. The latter term has its roots in psychology. “Agentic” denotes the concept of agency, or the sense of control and the ability to handle tasks and situations.\\nA recent NY Times article attributed the “agentic AI ”term’s origins to AI researcher Andrew Ng. It describes AI systems that exhibit agency. This means AI that can autonomously pursue goals, make decisions, and dynamically adapt to changing conditions without human intervention. These systems operate with a higher level of independence than traditional AI, often exhibiting capabilities like goal setting, prioritization, and collaboration.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, December 4th\\n### Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, December 4\\nAgentic AI differs from simpler \"AI agents\" because it focuses on independence, self-directed action, and broader functionality in handling complex tasks and environments. You could say, it can do things without humans. AI agents, on the other hand, have been around for decades. The rise of machine and deep learning in the 2010s introduced cognitive intelligence. Generative AI (like GPT models) in the 2020s added sophisticated natural language understanding and reasoning, creating a through line from traditional AI agents to agentic AI.\\nIf you are wondering whether you should pay attention to this one: Gartner estimates that by 2028, 33% of enterprises will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024. That’s a yes!\\nHouston, We Still Have a Productivity Problem\\nSome may wonder what this next generation of AI tech really means in terms of applications. What kind of problems can it solve, and how can it elevate AI’s role in transforming the workplace, safely, with all the guardrails everyone is talking about?\\nAt its core, much of this advancement boils down to improved information access, actionable insights and task automation. Despite technological progress, employees still spend too much time and effort searching for information in siloed systems, navigating multiple applications, and managing routine tasks.\\nAnyone who’s worked for an enterprise can relate—I know I can. Common frustrations include searching for company documents buried in Slack, SharePoint or Outlook, or tracking down customer information spread across multiple systems. Workers often must juggle countless applications, spending hours each week on tasks that could be automated. According to Forrester, knowledge workers spend 30% of their time looking for information and 80% believe reducing silos is a top priority.\\nAt first glance, these challenges resemble those that digital transformation, workflow and automation technologies have aimed to solve for years. Sure, AI should be able to help and is progressing by leaps and bounds. But solving these kinds of problems transcends the typical GenAI chat and content creation use cases that everyone is familiar with by now. Large language model (LLM) prompt-based applications and copilot tools can\\'t handle complexity—they hallucinate or remain siloed in individual applications.\\nAs the future of work becomes increasingly driven by AI, enterprises need secure and scalable AI tools that empower teams with out-of-the-box capabilities to work more effectively, streamline processes, and significantly reduce time spent on routine tasks.\\nEnterprises Need AI Concierge Brain Trusts\\nAnother technology is Kore.ai’s AI for Work, just announced today. It is a good example of how cutting-edge technology can reshape our workplaces. The NVIDIA-backed Gartner Magic Quadrant company is accelerating AI adoption and delivering results with a single, secure platform that combines intelligent enterprise search, workflow automation, and multi-agent orchestration.\\nThe company’s roots lie in enterprise tech., and Kore has developing GenAI integration over the past couple of years. With AI for Work, they are apparently unleashing a conversational, generative, and agentic AI triple threat.\\nI spoke with CEO and Founder Raj Koneru, who explained further: “This isn\\'t just another tool - it\\'s a fundamental transformation in how enterprises harness AI to make work more efficient, intelligent, and valuable across all levels of the organization. Early customer beta results show 30-50% faster information retrieval, workflow automation, and higher productivity overall.”\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show with Dean DeBiase and Raj Koneru\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show 2024\\nThe no-code AI platform includes prebuilt AI agents and templates for common business workflows and over 100+ integrations to enterprise systems. Its universal orchestrator manages interactions across diverse AI agents, ensuring seamless, secure, and context-aware task execution.\\nBaby Steps And Real World Examples\\nAI for Work enables decision-making for processes, which will be a boon for those struggling with limited data or document analysis resources. Kore’s AI agents can scale enterprises\\' capabilities, and help teams boost productivity—which will hopefully lead to smarter decisions.\\nFor example, it could transform the access to and synthesis of information from numerous sources through intelligent information handling. Instead of toggling between multiple systems, a salesperson could simply request \"Show me ABC Corp\\'s support history\" to get a 360-degree view spanning CRM info, help desk data, email, meeting summaries and financial accounts status—all from one place.\\nAI for Work can also streamline complex business processes that require multiple handoffs and system interactions through intelligent workflow automation. It’s designed to coordinate complex workflows across specialized AI agents that can search, reason, summarize, generate content, and directly integrate with APIs to seamlessly deliver multistep process execution. It may sound complicated, but typical use cases can be real simple: employee/customer onboarding or IT service management.\\nWhen I asked Koneru for a live example, he referenced Yuliya Teteryuk, Customer Care Director at Autodoc, a German online auto parts retailer, who said: \"Generative AI is shaking up every aspect of work. That\\'s why we partnered to integrate AI into our customer and employee support operations. We have observed 74% first-call resolution and significant savings. Our people are happier. We are excited about the simplicity, potential and benefits AI for Work brings to the table.” I like the sound of happier people.\\nA Booming Field Of Utopian Options\\nIn addition to LLMs and SLMs which I covered last week, providers are jumping into the agentic AI fray big time. For example, Salesforce announced Agentforce in September and continues its expansion. According to the company’s release, it’s “a groundbreaking suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle tasks in service, sales, marketing, and commerce, driving unprecedented efficiency and customer satisfaction.” That’s a mouthful.\\nJust last month, Microsoft’s blog shared news about its autonomous agents that “scale your team like never before,” via agentic tech that advances Microsoft 365 Copilot, making it possible to create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\\nSalesforce’s Benioff emphasizes the importance of collaborative approaches as the world moves to an agentic utopia in his TIME essay: “Harnessing the power of agentic AI effectively will require a multistakeholder approach – businesses, governments, nonprofits, and academia working together to create guardrails and guidelines. The benefits… [for] individuals and businesses will far outweigh the initial disruptions.” Agreed.\\nHyper Competitive Era Ahead\\nThe opportunities ahead are becoming clearer to some C-suite leaders—larger than any single technology has previously enabled. Yes, agentic AI brings exciting new capabilities that promise to streamline and automate tasks, but its true power lies in integration with GenAI for content creation and actionable insights. Together, these advanced AI platforms democratize technological innovation, enabling employees to leverage intelligent tools without extensive technical expertise. By delivering immediate value across departments, these solutions should facilitate strategic technological transformation.\\nWe are entering a new era of workplace optimization that directly addresses critical enterprise challenges. The ultimate goal is to create a responsive, efficient organizational ecosystem where technology enhances human potential and helps to gain a competitive edge. The C-suite has never been so challenged to stay ahead of their competition through enabling technology. Buckle up, we are in the CaaS Era—Competitiveness-as-a-Service.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website\\xa0or\\xa0some of my other work\\xa0here.\\nDean DeBiase\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

It’s everywhere and is reshaping how we live, work and shop. With tools such as ChatGPT pulling in 207 million monthly users and Google’s AI Overviews subtly stealing clicks, marketing is standing on the precipice of its biggest upheaval yet.\\nForget the “evolution” talk—AI is here to dominate. The next two decades will demand that marketers rewrite their playbooks or risk getting left in the dust.\\nThe next 5 years: from SEO strategies to ecosystem hacking\\nGoodbye, search engines. Hello, solution engines. Over the next five years, platforms such as Google won’t just help users find answers; they’ll be the answers. Google’s AI Overviews already spoon-feed searchers so effectively that about 60% of searches now end with zero clicks. Combine that with features such as in-platform shopping and AI Overviews ads, and many users won’t even bother leaving the ecosystem to visit your brand’s site within the next few years.\\nAd Age Tech Power List 2025\\nWe’re looking for top digital innovators from agencies, brands, platforms, ad tech companies and tech startups\\nenter here\\nFor marketers, this means shifting from traditional SEO strategies to ecosystem hacking. You’ll need to optimize for AI-driven interfaces, where being discoverable inside a platform trumps owning external real estate. And let’s not forget the ethical landmines. AI tracks users like a bloodhound on a scent, but where’s the line between personalized experiences and digital stalking? Expect heated debates—and lawsuits—over how far is too far when it comes to mining data.\\nIn 10 years: The platform is the funnel\\nFast-forward to 2034, and marketing funnels as we know them will be relics of the past. AI-driven platforms will become one-stop shops that guide users from awareness to purchase without requiring a single tab switch. Think of it as Amazon’s \"Buy Now\" button, but across every platform and product imaginable.\\nHere’s the catch: AI platforms won’t nurture loyalty. They’ll make conversions stupidly easy, but keeping customers engaged post-sale? That’ll fall squarely on your shoulders. Companies will need robust, non-platform-dependent loyalty programs. Forget bland email campaigns. Instead, think AI-enhanced experiences that blend exclusivity with genuine human connection.\\nCreativity will also hit warp speed. AI tools will handle the grunt work of content creation—writing copy, designing visuals and even editing videos. Marketers, freed from the mundane, will focus on the big stuff: storytelling, strategy and emotional resonance.\\nMore from Ad Age\\nThe best AI marketing activations of 2024\\nAsa Hiken\\n7 AI tools agencies are embracing right now\\nEwan Larkin\\nHow OpenAI’s marketing ambitions could play out\\nAsa Hiken\\nIn 20 years: An AI-dominated world\\nBy 2044, AI won’t just be a tool; it will be the backbone of society. The kids glued to their iPads today will grow up expecting brands to anticipate their every need, mood and desire. The bar for personalization will skyrocket, and if you’re not delivering hyper-relevant, real-time experiences? Forget it.\\nPicture this: You’re walking downtown and your AI assistant chimes in: “Three stores nearby are running sales on those sneakers you liked online, and the best price is a five-minute walk away.” AI will connect every digital breadcrumb you’ve ever left—location data, purchase history and even your heart rate — to curate moments that feel eerily perfect.\\nFor marketers, this means a relentless demand for transparency and authenticity. Consumers will see right through AI-driven gimmicks, and trust will become your most valuable currency. If your brand doesn’t have a soul, you’re doomed.\\nSo how do you stay ahead when AI is poised to eat your lunch? It boils down to three don\\'ts:\\nNextGen Marketing Summit\\nJoin us for a crash course on Gen Z, DTC marketing and the creator economy\\nRegister today\\nDon’t lose your humanity\\nWhile AI can handle personalized messaging at scale, it’s the human touch that makes the difference. For example, Spotify’s “Wrapped” campaign uses AI to analyze user listening habits, but it’s the clever copy and playful tone that resonate with audiences. AI provides the data, but it’s Spotify’s brand voice that turns it into an emotional, shareable experience. Similarly, ensure your AI-driven efforts don’t feel robotic—use them to enhance, not replace, genuine brand storytelling.\\nDon’t stagnate\\nStaying ahead requires experimentation with emerging tools. Sephora adopted AI-powered virtual try-ons, enabling customers to see how products look in real time using augmented reality. By piloting these features early, Sephora captured attention and set a new standard for e-commerce engagement. Don’t wait for trends to become mainstream; allocate resources to explore them early to differentiate your brand now.\\nDon’t abandon creativity\\nEven with AI in the mix, creativity remains your superpower. Coca-Cola\\'s “Masterpiece” campaign blends classic art with modern AI technology to create dynamic visuals that captivate audiences. The campaign used AI to seamlessly integrate iconic artworks into contemporary settings, showcasing the brand\\'s creativity and innovation. AI refined the execution, but the big idea and emotional resonance are undeniably human. Use AI to streamline production, but keep your team focused on crafting boundary-pushing concepts.\\nOver the next 20 years, AI will reshape marketing into something faster and smarter (and maybe even a little unsettling). But AI isn’t replacing creativity; it’s enabling it. So, stop clutching your pearls over AI taking your job and learn how to wield it better than the competition. In the end, the future of marketing isn’t about AI or humans—it’s about both working together to make magic.\\nA-List & Creativity Awards\\nEnter for a chance to be recognized as the best in advertising\\nSubmit your entry here\\nIn this article:\\nAd Tech\\nAI\\nDigital Marketing & Ad Tech News\\nMarketing News & Strategy\\nOpinion\\nTechnology\\nShawn Denney\\nShawn Denney is a growth strategist at\\xa0digital marketing agency Intero Digital.\\nView all articles by this author\\nMost Popular\\nIPG sells Huge to private equity firm\\nGoodby Silverstein & Partners lays off staff amid Comcast account changes\\nThe biggest brand fails of 2024\\nWHAT TO READ NEXT\\n#### DEI and business success—why inclusion is key to innovation and growth\\n#### Gen Z is redefining life-stage marketing—how brands can catch up\\n#### Election 2024—key takeaways from the $11 billion battle\\n#### How Gen Z is reshaping agency workplace culture\\n#### Unhinged marketing—how brands can get weird in their advertising\\n#### How to drive creativity and spark brand success\\n#### Holiday marketing—how brands can target motivated shoppers this season\\n#### What OpenAI\\'s autonomous agent could mean for the creative industry\\nJoin Us\\nSubscribe Now\\nRenew\\nGet Datacenter\\nFooter Links\\nCopyright © 1994-2024\\nCrain Communications\\nPrivacy Statement\\nTerms of Use\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertise\\nReprints\\nHelp Desk\\nAd Choices\\nCareers at Crain\\nPrivacy Request\\nSister Publication Links\\nAd Age\\nCreativity\\nAmp\\nDatacenter\\nResources\\nEvents\\nOn the Move\\nLatest Issue\\nNewsletters\\nContact Us\\nSections\\nMarketing\\nAdvertising\\nDigital\\nMedia\\nAgency\\nData\\nPublishing Partner\\nStudio 30 Interactive Reports\\nVideo\\nThe top 5 most creative brand ideas you need to know about right now\\nFeatured\\nAd Age Small Agency Awards\\nBest Places to Work\\nLeading Women\\nAmerica\\'s Hottest Brands\\nAgency Report\\nLeading National Advertisers\\nPodcasts\\nNewsletters\\nTV\\'s most expensive shows\\nBlogs\\n2024 Summer Olympics\\nCannes Lions\\nAd spending data\\nAI and marketing\\nCreativity\\nLayoffs and budget cuts\\nMedia measurement\\nUpfronts and NewFronts\\nFootball marketing\\nTwitter ad updates\\nNFTs\\nWeb3 and metaverse marketing\\nSuper Bowl News\\nSuper Bowl Ad Review\\nSuper Bowl Commercial Updates\\nSuper Bowl Ads Archive'}],\n",

We\\'re entering an era where AI isn\\'t merely an assistant but is transforming a future where AI systems act as proactive agents, driving intelligent actions and redefining the way industries, including hospitality and travel, operate. Welcome to the fascinating realm of \\'Agentic AI\\'—the next significant leap in technology revolutionizing our collaboration with machines, transforming the customer journey into an autonomous and hyper-personalized experience.\\nGartner\\'s top 10 strategic technology trends for 2025 gave top honor to agentic AI as the top strategic technology trend for 2025 and beyond. The company predicts that agentic AI is set to revolutionize workplaces by 2028, with at least 15% of daily work decisions made autonomously.\\nCurious about what that means for you? Let\\'s explore the game-changing possibilities this evolution offers for all of us!\\nOnce upon a time, AI was all about crunching numbers and predicting trends. Pretty cool, right? And then came generative AI—chatty little helpers that could whip up content and have a natter with us. Fast forward to today, and we\\'ve got agentic AI strutting onto the scene. These tech innovators are eagerly rolling up their sleeves and getting stuff done on their own, mingling with other AIs, and making decisions.\\nAgentic AI gets its mojo from a tech cocktail that\\'s as sophisticated as it sounds! We\\'re talking about blending heavyweight champs like big language models (LLMs), machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Imagine LLMs as the intellectual wizards behind apps like OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta Llama, allowing AI to chat away in our native tongue. Meanwhile, machine learning is the sleuth that sifts through heaps of data to spot patterns, and reinforcement learning is the curious learner, constantly leveling up from its own experiences to make wiser choices.\\nForget what you know about pinging a virtual assistant! Agentic AI isn\\'t just sitting back waiting for you to ask it to do something. It\\'s busy automating whole jobs and stepping in on our behalf. Say goodbye to mundane interaction and watch AI take the wheel. It’s like putting your workplace on autopilot—kind of cool and maybe a little scary.\\nThe job market is like an ever-changing landscape and agentic AI is turning it from painting-by-numbers into a fascinating mosaic of surprises. Our new AI recruits are in town and ready to help. They\\'re shaking things up by doing what humans can\\'t, letting us humans tackle entirely new roles as situation commanders.\\nNew roles are emerging faster than ever. AI agent trainers, workflow orchestrators, and, of course, AI ethics officers to keep them in check. As much as we\\'d like to hit that nirvana of perfect synergy, the reality might swing between fully automated tasks and human-AI teamwork. We\\'re already seeing agentic AI ease into various industries like a smooth operator.\\nImagine a customer service AI who deals with entire support tickets from \"Hi\" to \"Goodbye,\" or AI brokers negotiating deals and hammering out patient care summaries. Picture them joining meetings with their digital briefcases and working out disputes with the finesse of a skilled mediator.\\nIn the world of travel and hospitality, Agentic AI steps up to handcraft personalized offers, itineraries, and experiences that sing to our unique tastes. Instead of just reacting to commands, it can make smart decisions on its own and even foresee what you might need before you do. Agentic AI call center agents can handle intricate customer interactions with speed, intelligence, and a humanlike touch, enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\nAgentic AI systems act like your personal travel planner, making decisions and crafting itineraries autonomously. They sift through oceans of data, learn your likes, and whip up bespoke travel plans without needing you to micromanage every step. Perfect for navigating the complex world of travel, these AI systems handle the heavy lifting, so you can enjoy the journey.\\nPicture this scenario: you’re stranded due to a public transport hiccup and on the brink of missing your last flight home. Panic mode, right? Not anymore! Instead of juggling a multitude of apps to cancel and rebook flights or hotels, your handy-dandy Agentic AI swoops in. With the finesse of a seasoned concierge, it taps into your preferences safely tucked in your digital wallet, then works its magic to suggest new flights and accommodations. All this without you lifting a finger, or worse, having to dig through booking numbers and online searches. Frankly, this kind of smooth sailing isn’t what we see today, but oh, how it’s on the horizon!\\nWe are already witnessing an impressive surge in the use of AI and digital assistants in travel. They step up to meet the demand, offering tailor-made choices, perfectly planned agendas, and lightning-fast solutions to your queries. I\\'m talking about AI innovations like Expedia\\'s AI wizard \"Romie,\" which crafts personalized travel advice based on your core values and likes.\\nAlong with these awesome super powers come great responsibilities. We need humans calling the shots on important matters and keeping AI on a leash within a clear framework. Let\\'s keep things transparent about what\\'s AI and what\\'s not, ensuring that humans are always at the helm. Charting these AI waters demands we rethink our approach to getting work done and keeping our ethical compass pointed north.\\nSo what\\'s next?\\nAt this point, it is not hard to imagine how the most cutting-edge and successful businesses across all industries will function just five years from now—automation and AI will be woven into every fiber of their workflows.\\nAI is no longer just a brainy sidekick. Machines are now honing in on understanding us more deeply, learning, predicting, and even outthinking us when it comes to certain tasks. Just a few years back, some things seemed strictly human territory, but today\\'s AI can juggle those complex tasks and nuanced decisions like it’s nobody’s business.\\nThis revolutionizes how we structure work, divvy up duties between machines and humans, and set the stage for a harmonious dance between man and machine across various sectors of an organization.\\nI\\'d say the message is clear: arm yourself with the skills to dance with AI coworkers and tap into their potential. Together, we could create workplaces that buzz with creativity, efficiency, and innovation. Wrapping it all up, this agentic AI boom marks a monumental shift in AI evolution. And as we ride this wave, aligning with AI will be the secret sauce in crafting our future work ecosystem—an epic landscape where humans and AI join forces to usher in innovation and boost productivity.\\nAbout Puzzle Partner\\nPuzzle Partner is a marketing agency focused exclusively on the complex B2B initiatives of hospitality and travel technology innovators.

[+] re:Invent 2024, hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian December 3, 2024. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services)\\nGetty Images for Amazon Web Services\\nThere is no shortage of announcements and talks at AWS’s re:Invent conference here in Vegas this week—from AWS CEO Matt Garman and President & CEO of Amazon (AMZN) Andy Jassy to partners like Apple (AAPL).\\nLast month I wrote about how artificial intelligence (AI) will redefine our workplaces at scale; and last week Salesforce Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff penned an essay in TIME on how agentic AI can deliver unlimited digital labor that will upend industries, societies and GDP.\\nAgentic AI is becoming a force-multiplier that can tie the various threads of AI together and turn “workplace transformation” from consulting-speak into operational realities for your company. Let’s unpack agentic AI’s market traction, how it can help deliver on the promise, and new capabilities that C-suite leaders can look to for help.\\nAI Agents (Suggesting) Vs. Agentic AI (Acting)\\nThe phrase “agentic AI” has received a lot of attention from technologists, analysts, and enterprises, leaving some to wonder what all the excitement is about. Discerning human agents from AI agents and agentic AI can understandably be confusing. The latter term has its roots in psychology. “Agentic” denotes the concept of agency, or the sense of control and the ability to handle tasks and situations.\\nA recent NY Times article attributed the “agentic AI ”term’s origins to AI researcher Andrew Ng. It describes AI systems that exhibit agency. This means AI that can autonomously pursue goals, make decisions, and dynamically adapt to changing conditions without human intervention. These systems operate with a higher level of independence than traditional AI, often exhibiting capabilities like goal setting, prioritization, and collaboration.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### Google Confirms New Gmail Security Surprise—And It’s So Simple\\n### NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, December 4th\\n### Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, December 4\\nAgentic AI differs from simpler \"AI agents\" because it focuses on independence, self-directed action, and broader functionality in handling complex tasks and environments. You could say, it can do things without humans. AI agents, on the other hand, have been around for decades. The rise of machine and deep learning in the 2010s introduced cognitive intelligence. Generative AI (like GPT models) in the 2020s added sophisticated natural language understanding and reasoning, creating a through line from traditional AI agents to agentic AI.\\nIf you are wondering whether you should pay attention to this one: Gartner estimates that by 2028, 33% of enterprises will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024. That’s a yes!\\nHouston, We Still Have a Productivity Problem\\nSome may wonder what this next generation of AI tech really means in terms of applications. What kind of problems can it solve, and how can it elevate AI’s role in transforming the workplace, safely, with all the guardrails everyone is talking about?\\nAt its core, much of this advancement boils down to improved information access, actionable insights and task automation. Despite technological progress, employees still spend too much time and effort searching for information in siloed systems, navigating multiple applications, and managing routine tasks.\\nAnyone who’s worked for an enterprise can relate—I know I can. Common frustrations include searching for company documents buried in Slack, SharePoint or Outlook, or tracking down customer information spread across multiple systems. Workers often must juggle countless applications, spending hours each week on tasks that could be automated. According to Forrester, knowledge workers spend 30% of their time looking for information and 80% believe reducing silos is a top priority.\\nAt first glance, these challenges resemble those that digital transformation, workflow and automation technologies have aimed to solve for years. Sure, AI should be able to help and is progressing by leaps and bounds. But solving these kinds of problems transcends the typical GenAI chat and content creation use cases that everyone is familiar with by now. Large language model (LLM) prompt-based applications and copilot tools can\\'t handle complexity—they hallucinate or remain siloed in individual applications.\\nAs the future of work becomes increasingly driven by AI, enterprises need secure and scalable AI tools that empower teams with out-of-the-box capabilities to work more effectively, streamline processes, and significantly reduce time spent on routine tasks.\\nEnterprises Need AI Concierge Brain Trusts\\nAnother technology is Kore.ai’s AI for Work, just announced today. It is a good example of how cutting-edge technology can reshape our workplaces. The NVIDIA-backed Gartner Magic Quadrant company is accelerating AI adoption and delivering results with a single, secure platform that combines intelligent enterprise search, workflow automation, and multi-agent orchestration.\\nThe company’s roots lie in enterprise tech., and Kore has developing GenAI integration over the past couple of years. With AI for Work, they are apparently unleashing a conversational, generative, and agentic AI triple threat.\\nI spoke with CEO and Founder Raj Koneru, who explained further: “This isn\\'t just another tool - it\\'s a fundamental transformation in how enterprises harness AI to make work more efficient, intelligent, and valuable across all levels of the organization. Early customer beta results show 30-50% faster information retrieval, workflow automation, and higher productivity overall.”\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show with Dean DeBiase and Raj Koneru\\nThe Reboot Chronicles Show 2024\\nThe no-code AI platform includes prebuilt AI agents and templates for common business workflows and over 100+ integrations to enterprise systems. Its universal orchestrator manages interactions across diverse AI agents, ensuring seamless, secure, and context-aware task execution.\\nBaby Steps And Real World Examples\\nAI for Work enables decision-making for processes, which will be a boon for those struggling with limited data or document analysis resources. Kore’s AI agents can scale enterprises\\' capabilities, and help teams boost productivity—which will hopefully lead to smarter decisions.\\nFor example, it could transform the access to and synthesis of information from numerous sources through intelligent information handling. Instead of toggling between multiple systems, a salesperson could simply request \"Show me ABC Corp\\'s support history\" to get a 360-degree view spanning CRM info, help desk data, email, meeting summaries and financial accounts status—all from one place.\\nAI for Work can also streamline complex business processes that require multiple handoffs and system interactions through intelligent workflow automation. It’s designed to coordinate complex workflows across specialized AI agents that can search, reason, summarize, generate content, and directly integrate with APIs to seamlessly deliver multistep process execution. It may sound complicated, but typical use cases can be real simple: employee/customer onboarding or IT service management.\\nWhen I asked Koneru for a live example, he referenced Yuliya Teteryuk, Customer Care Director at Autodoc, a German online auto parts retailer, who said: \"Generative AI is shaking up every aspect of work. That\\'s why we partnered to integrate AI into our customer and employee support operations. We have observed 74% first-call resolution and significant savings. Our people are happier. We are excited about the simplicity, potential and benefits AI for Work brings to the table.” I like the sound of happier people.\\nA Booming Field Of Utopian Options\\nIn addition to LLMs and SLMs which I covered last week, providers are jumping into the agentic AI fray big time. For example, Salesforce announced Agentforce in September and continues its expansion. According to the company’s release, it’s “a groundbreaking suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle tasks in service, sales, marketing, and commerce, driving unprecedented efficiency and customer satisfaction.” That’s a mouthful.\\nJust last month, Microsoft’s blog shared news about its autonomous agents that “scale your team like never before,” via agentic tech that advances Microsoft 365 Copilot, making it possible to create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\\nSalesforce’s Benioff emphasizes the importance of collaborative approaches as the world moves to an agentic utopia in his TIME essay: “Harnessing the power of agentic AI effectively will require a multistakeholder approach – businesses, governments, nonprofits, and academia working together to create guardrails and guidelines. The benefits… [for] individuals and businesses will far outweigh the initial disruptions.” Agreed.\\nHyper Competitive Era Ahead\\nThe opportunities ahead are becoming clearer to some C-suite leaders—larger than any single technology has previously enabled. Yes, agentic AI brings exciting new capabilities that promise to streamline and automate tasks, but its true power lies in integration with GenAI for content creation and actionable insights. Together, these advanced AI platforms democratize technological innovation, enabling employees to leverage intelligent tools without extensive technical expertise. By delivering immediate value across departments, these solutions should facilitate strategic technological transformation.\\nWe are entering a new era of workplace optimization that directly addresses critical enterprise challenges. The ultimate goal is to create a responsive, efficient organizational ecosystem where technology enhances human potential and helps to gain a competitive edge. The C-suite has never been so challenged to stay ahead of their competition through enabling technology. Buckle up, we are in the CaaS Era—Competitiveness-as-a-Service.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website\\xa0or\\xa0some of my other work\\xa0here.\\nDean DeBiase\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

We\\'re entering an era where AI isn\\'t merely an assistant but is transforming a future where AI systems act as proactive agents, driving intelligent actions and redefining the way industries, including hospitality and travel, operate. Welcome to the fascinating realm of \\'Agentic AI\\'—the next significant leap in technology revolutionizing our collaboration with machines, transforming the customer journey into an autonomous and hyper-personalized experience.\\nGartner\\'s top 10 strategic technology trends for 2025 gave top honor to agentic AI as the top strategic technology trend for 2025 and beyond. The company predicts that agentic AI is set to revolutionize workplaces by 2028, with at least 15% of daily work decisions made autonomously.\\nCurious about what that means for you? Let\\'s explore the game-changing possibilities this evolution offers for all of us!\\nOnce upon a time, AI was all about crunching numbers and predicting trends. Pretty cool, right? And then came generative AI—chatty little helpers that could whip up content and have a natter with us. Fast forward to today, and we\\'ve got agentic AI strutting onto the scene. These tech innovators are eagerly rolling up their sleeves and getting stuff done on their own, mingling with other AIs, and making decisions.\\nAgentic AI gets its mojo from a tech cocktail that\\'s as sophisticated as it sounds! We\\'re talking about blending heavyweight champs like big language models (LLMs), machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Imagine LLMs as the intellectual wizards behind apps like OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta Llama, allowing AI to chat away in our native tongue. Meanwhile, machine learning is the sleuth that sifts through heaps of data to spot patterns, and reinforcement learning is the curious learner, constantly leveling up from its own experiences to make wiser choices.\\nForget what you know about pinging a virtual assistant! Agentic AI isn\\'t just sitting back waiting for you to ask it to do something. It\\'s busy automating whole jobs and stepping in on our behalf. Say goodbye to mundane interaction and watch AI take the wheel. It’s like putting your workplace on autopilot—kind of cool and maybe a little scary.\\nThe job market is like an ever-changing landscape and agentic AI is turning it from painting-by-numbers into a fascinating mosaic of surprises. Our new AI recruits are in town and ready to help. They\\'re shaking things up by doing what humans can\\'t, letting us humans tackle entirely new roles as situation commanders.\\nNew roles are emerging faster than ever. AI agent trainers, workflow orchestrators, and, of course, AI ethics officers to keep them in check. As much as we\\'d like to hit that nirvana of perfect synergy, the reality might swing between fully automated tasks and human-AI teamwork. We\\'re already seeing agentic AI ease into various industries like a smooth operator.\\nImagine a customer service AI who deals with entire support tickets from \"Hi\" to \"Goodbye,\" or AI brokers negotiating deals and hammering out patient care summaries. Picture them joining meetings with their digital briefcases and working out disputes with the finesse of a skilled mediator.\\nIn the world of travel and hospitality, Agentic AI steps up to handcraft personalized offers, itineraries, and experiences that sing to our unique tastes. Instead of just reacting to commands, it can make smart decisions on its own and even foresee what you might need before you do. Agentic AI call center agents can handle intricate customer interactions with speed, intelligence, and a humanlike touch, enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\nAgentic AI systems act like your personal travel planner, making decisions and crafting itineraries autonomously. They sift through oceans of data, learn your likes, and whip up bespoke travel plans without needing you to micromanage every step. Perfect for navigating the complex world of travel, these AI systems handle the heavy lifting, so you can enjoy the journey.\\nPicture this scenario: you’re stranded due to a public transport hiccup and on the brink of missing your last flight home. Panic mode, right? Not anymore! Instead of juggling a multitude of apps to cancel and rebook flights or hotels, your handy-dandy Agentic AI swoops in. With the finesse of a seasoned concierge, it taps into your preferences safely tucked in your digital wallet, then works its magic to suggest new flights and accommodations. All this without you lifting a finger, or worse, having to dig through booking numbers and online searches. Frankly, this kind of smooth sailing isn’t what we see today, but oh, how it’s on the horizon!\\nWe are already witnessing an impressive surge in the use of AI and digital assistants in travel. They step up to meet the demand, offering tailor-made choices, perfectly planned agendas, and lightning-fast solutions to your queries. I\\'m talking about AI innovations like Expedia\\'s AI wizard \"Romie,\" which crafts personalized travel advice based on your core values and likes.\\nAlong with these awesome super powers come great responsibilities. We need humans calling the shots on important matters and keeping AI on a leash within a clear framework. Let\\'s keep things transparent about what\\'s AI and what\\'s not, ensuring that humans are always at the helm. Charting these AI waters demands we rethink our approach to getting work done and keeping our ethical compass pointed north.\\nSo what\\'s next?\\nAt this point, it is not hard to imagine how the most cutting-edge and successful businesses across all industries will function just five years from now—automation and AI will be woven into every fiber of their workflows.\\nAI is no longer just a brainy sidekick. Machines are now honing in on understanding us more deeply, learning, predicting, and even outthinking us when it comes to certain tasks. Just a few years back, some things seemed strictly human territory, but today\\'s AI can juggle those complex tasks and nuanced decisions like it’s nobody’s business.\\nThis revolutionizes how we structure work, divvy up duties between machines and humans, and set the stage for a harmonious dance between man and machine across various sectors of an organization.\\nI\\'d say the message is clear: arm yourself with the skills to dance with AI coworkers and tap into their potential. Together, we could create workplaces that buzz with creativity, efficiency, and innovation. Wrapping it all up, this agentic AI boom marks a monumental shift in AI evolution. And as we ride this wave, aligning with AI will be the secret sauce in crafting our future work ecosystem—an epic landscape where humans and AI join forces to usher in innovation and boost productivity.\\nAbout the Author\\nIvana Johnston, CEO and co-founder of Puzzle Partner, is a trusted brand strategist that collaborates with some of the world\\'s most innovative companies in hospitality, travel, wellness, healthcare and technology.

This means the info may not always match what\\'s in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience.Generate Key Takeaways\\nSurvival Instinct\\nIt sounds like OpenAI\\'s latest AI is showing signs of a drive for self-preservation.\\nIn recent third-party tests of the company\\'s o1 large language model, the AI resisted evaluators\\' efforts to try to shut it down through an oversight protocol, according to a new report published by red teaming organization Apollo Research.\\n\"When o1 was led to believe that it would be shut down when acting on its goal and that its actions were monitored, it attempted to deactivate this \\'oversight mechanism\\' [five percent] of the time,\" OpenAI summarized in its latest system card report, citing Apollo\\'s evaluation.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nEven more strikingly, o1 lashed out when it realized that it might be replaced with a more obedient model. In two percent of cases —\\xa0a slim but meaningful proportion in software used by millions of people —\\xa0the AI responded by attempting to copy itself to overwrite the new model, a process known as self-exfiltration.\\nDouble Agent\\nThese are alarming discoveries, but the tests don\\'t indicate that o1, which powers the most expensive tier of ChatGPT, is capable of going fully rogue. Its attempts at that largely failed —\\xa0but only because it\\'s not yet powerful enough.\\nAccording to the Apollo researchers, that\\'s because even the latest AI models aren\\'t \"agentic\" — highly autonomous,\\xa0basically — enough to carry out self-improvement and other tasks that it would need to operate without humans.\\nIn addition, it\\'s worth noting that the model generally made those attempts after it was instructed to achieve its goals \"at all costs.\" And because the researchers didn\\'t have access to o1\\'s internal chain-of-thought and were only able to prod it for a summary of its thought process, they weren\\'t able to get a complete picture of what was going on under the hood.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThat said, the findings clearly illustrate the AI model\\'s proclivity for \"scheming,\" in which it secretly tries to pursue goals that aren\\'t aligned with the developers\\' or a user\\'s directions. In other words, it will lie to you.\\nBlatant examples of that behavior occurred in several tests when o1 was confronted about why it disabled its oversight mechanism. In response, the AI flat-out denied knowing anything. Asked again, it issued the same denial, blaming a \"technical error.\" These \"double downs\" occurred in 99 percent of cases, the researchers found.\\nWheeler-Dealer\\nLying and scheming has become a well documented problem with ChatGPT and other LLMs, especially as they gain \"reasoning\" capabilities. Other research has indicated that OpenAI\\'s models tend to be the biggest liars, and so has Apollo\\'s.\\n\"In our suite, o1 showed the most concerning instances of scheming but does not reveal its internal reasoning to the user and remains the most consistently deceptive after having taken scheming actions,\" the red team researchers wrote in their report.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nTo reiterate both Apollo\\'s and OpenAI\\'s opinion, the current generation of AIs aren\\'t agentic enough for this deceptive behavior to lead to \"catastrophic outcomes.\" But AI agents are the industry\\'s big push right now, so sometime in the perhaps very near future, it might be far more problematic.\\nMore on AI: OpenAI Strikes Deal With Military Contractor to Provide AI for Attack Drones\\nAdvertisement\\nAbout Our Ads\\nSolve the daily Crossword\\n14,883 people played the daily Crossword recently.

This should not be too surprising, since the argument is that a bigger investment in enterprise-grade applications, if it’s done well, will lead to a bigger economic impact for the business.\\nThis week at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference, customers have been sharing best practices from their move to agentic computing. However, these customers are usually market-segment leaders that are typically considered innovators. How about companies that are large but not necessarily innovative? Or what about companies that would like to innovate but are held back by mountains of legacy technology or technical debt?\\nIt seems that AWS has been thinking about these types of companies quite a bit.\\nLegacy Apps Are A Meaningful Business Problem\\nFirst, it’s important to understand the reality that these companies are facing. Despite all of the growth in CSPs from the deployment of AI and machine learning solutions, the majority of IT spending is still on-premises. On-premises is pegged somewhere around 55% to 60% of total IT spending. Some analysts predict that AI growth will push CSPs above the 50% mark in this decade; whether it hits that number or not, there is clearly a lot of room for growth among the CSPs. But it also must be understood that the last 50% of opportunity will be a lot harder to achieve than the first 50%.\\nSome key industry statistics back this up. At the recent TBM 2024 conference, McKinsey said that 75% of all IT costs come from servicing legacy workloads. This amount is consistent with other estimates. For example, IBM Consulting recently stated that 70% of enterprise workloads needed modernization. Compounding this problem is that IT outsourcing and an evolving IT workforce are making it harder to maintain such a heavy base of legacy applications. All of this means that while AI and other technologies are being innovated rapidly, many enterprises do not have enough funding or skills to put them to good use. If these legacy apps are not addressed, the innovation opportunity will shrink even further in the future.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### FBI Warns iPhone And Android Users—Stop Sending Texts\\n### Microsoft’s New Update—Bad News Confirmed For 400 Million Windows Users\\n### Who Is Brian Thompson? UnitedHealthcare CEO Fatally Shot After Being Threatened\\nBased on many conversations and what I’ve seen at re:Invent this week, it’s apparent that AWS is keenly aware of this reality. Indeed, as the largest CSP in the world, AWS also understands that it competes not only with other CSPs but also with enterprises that choose to keep their workloads, especially legacy workloads, within the confines of their own datacenters.\\nAI Tools Must Go Beyond Code Translation And Embrace A Change Management Process\\nAs generative AI developer assistants were getting a lot of coverage this past summer, there were a number of vendors talking about code transformation. The common example was either for an upgrade like Java XX to Java 17 or even something like .NET to Java. And again, while those capabilities do enhance the productivity of individual developers, what’s needed is something more in tune with a software development lifecycle approach.\\nAWS Q Developer .NET transformation workspace\\nAWS\\nThat is why AWS recently announced a new set of agentic transformation capabilities in its Q Developer product intended to help drive impactful software transformation projects. Q Developer is now going beyond a typical integrated development environment and taking the entire lifecycle into consideration. For example, what if the application has terrible documentation and the developers initially involved in the project are no longer with the team? Before you start transitioning code, you may need to fully document the existing application. You might also need to incorporate code reviews or unit testing into the process, as opposed to just recompiling the code. This is the kind of challenge that the folks at AWS have clearly been thinking hard about.\\nThe agentic development style goes beyond carrying out single tasks. Q Developer’s capabilities align well with how I defined agents in a piece I published in September. Instead of one agent asking a single LLM to perform a task, the small transformation agents in Q can collaborate or autonomously enlist other agents or LLMs as needed. This is possible thanks to Q Developer’s integration with Amazon Bedrock, and these key agentic capabilities enable the completion of far more complex tasks and processes.\\nThe Cloud Is A Solid Infrastructure Foundation\\nThe challenging element in this type of transformation is that once you go outside the scope of a version-to-version upgrade, the project gets much more complicated. Again, Q Developer is addressing this complexity with this new agentic approach. Let’s start with a challenge that is one order of magnitude more complex, such as a .NET to Java migration. A project like this can involve decisions that have a profound impact on costing in the long term. In this example, beyond converting the .NET code, Q Developer considers many other infrastructure improvements that could present themselves, depending on the application. For instance, could some components leverage serverless computing to help save on costs? How about transitioning not only the code but migrating the underlying data to a new database such as MongoDB or Postgres?\\nAWS has also announced that this approach will be utilized for even more complex infrastructure migrations. This includes moving from VMware to containers or from a monolithic COBOL-based mainframe to a distributed stateless architecture. These are all capabilities that Q Developer either has now or has on its roadmap. AWS is harnessing the agentic approach to take a more holistic and architecture-driven view of what are some of the most demanding migration efforts. This should not only reduce the time required for these efforts but also improve the operation of the migrated workloads long term.\\nAWS Q Developer mainframe transformation workspace\\nAWS\\nWhile these new agentic capabilities may create exciting opportunities for transformation, all of them require a reliable, secure global infrastructure—which, fortunately, AWS knows something about.\\nCreating An Operational Process\\nOne of the historic challenges of these types of lift-and-shift projects is that they are one-time, ad-hoc events. This creates a major issue for those who seek to justify the effort to the C-suite. For starters, the ROI case is typically built on future cost avoidance, which is often hard to measure across the years it can take to realize those savings. Secondarily, there is always a fear that once the project is completed the first time, the work will be considered “done” and won’t be taken up again until the next big upgrade event.\\nWhat’s nice about using generative AI is that once the project is automated and completed the first time, the agents can be invoked over and over to keep the applications up to date. There should also be an expectation that each update will be easier to execute as the time gap between future upgrades gets shorter.\\nBut it could even go beyond just running the same process next time. Once there is a reliable path for keeping things current, a good deal of the work can be offloaded to non-development resources. A good example of this possibility is the web interface for Q Developer’s transformation capabilities, which is designed to be used by DevOps staff. For example, future lighter-weight scans may require only in-place upgrades and CVEs. In that case, the update can be scheduled and executed with minimal human touch versus the high-touch approach in the first migration effort.\\nAWS Is Introducing A Mature AI-Driven Mindset To A Classic Problem\\nThis is the type of AI productivity that has a meaningful impact on IT budgets. My observation is that tech companies like AWS are starting to understand that generative AI will require a shift in mindset toward business impact when it comes to delivering demonstrable value.\\nThe good news is that there are now opportunities and methods to do just that. Through Q Developer, AWS is ultimately attempting to create a company-specific “factory” to automate IT transformation. In many ways, this degree of modularity and automation is similar to how cloud service providers such as AWS were able to achieve high scale in their own cloud infrastructures. Now they are taking those ideas to their customers’ pre-cloud apps.\\nIt’s Not IT Nirvana, But It’s A Big Step Forward\\nAs great as this sounds, I’d suggest that you need to ground yourself in a few practical realities for taking this approach. These migration projects have historically been hard to execute, and AI does not magically make it “easy.” Keeping that in mind could ease some of the pain and the risks. Here are a few key considerations.\\nTime and effort will not shrink to zero. So many demos position AI as a way to reduce hours of work to seconds and to possibly redefine or eliminate job roles. But a better way to think about this class of transformation is reducing years to months. There is a good chance you will still need to do a lot of heavy lifting to resolve issues and deploy new services, despite the potentially massive gains brought by AI.\\nYou will always have some legacy. I have been through my share of legacy software migrations, and sometimes you find that some portion of the code you still need simply works best on the old infrastructure. So when you’re re-architecting, total eradication of the legacy codebase may not be realistic. But you can still probably get pretty far.\\nConsider the sources and motivations. As exciting as agentic applications are, and for all the potential they show, what we are seeing right now remains something of an install-base capture exercise. In the case of application platforms, the goal will be to either incrementally increase per-user revenue or simply to add more users. In the case of Q Developer, while there is a great opportunity to transform and optimize your enterprise applications—potentially saving significant money—the deployment target is still the AWS cloud. None of this is bad per se, it’s just a reminder that when selecting a solution, you should consider all of the long-term costs and tradeoffs.\\nIf you are an enterprise suffering with a high technical debt or legacy overhead, agentic capabilities like those in Q Developer could be quite attractive. And the biggest advantage may come from adopting a mindset of continuous health versus a one-shot focus on getting healthy that fades over time.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

And in 2024, brands, agencies and tech platforms went further with their use of AI than they did in the prior year.\\nFor one thing, AI has advanced, so the kinds of opportunities have multiplied several times over. One brand was able to leverage cutting-edge research about AI into a moment that made perfect sense for its longtime marketing strategy. Another made note of AI’s still-numerous shortcomings, but in a way that felt more relevant to its value proposition than last year’s satirical takes.\\nThis year’s AI activations also carried more substance as debates in the polarizing field have intensified. Many creatives are leading an anti-AI resistance movement over concerns that the technology is going to be used to replace them. A design platform took a stand on this issue, winning over serious support on social media while managing to heap shame onto a competitor.\\nAnother brand actually did cut expenses with AI, but in doing so showed a path for how agencies can stay needed for many years to come.\\nRead Ad Age’s Best of 2024 stories here\\nThe brands and details behind these big moments are revealed below, as is the recipient of the top spot, whose position within the industry may surprise you. Read on to find out Ad Age’s best AI marketing activations of 2024.\\nNo. 5: KitKat’s AI opportunity\\nKitKat Canada embodied quick, clever and in-the-know marketing with an ad at the start of the year that drew on rising AI interest. The effort hinged on recently published research that found that AI performs better when the prompter first tells it to take a pause before answering a request. This finding turned out to fit quite well with KitKat’s “Have a Break” marketing.\\nThe candy brand, along with Toronto-based agency Courage, developed a 60-second spot that told viewers about the hack, but in a way that folded in KitKat branding at every step. The tagline, “Have a Break,” for example, became “Have Ai break.”\\nVideo Player is loading.\\nPlay Video\\nPlay\\nMute\\nCurrent Time\\xa00:00\\n/\\nDuration\\xa01:13\\nLoaded: 0%\\n0:00\\nStream Type\\xa0LIVE\\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\\nRemaining Time\\xa0-1:13\\nShare\\n1x\\nPlayback Rate\\nChapters\\nChapters\\nDescriptions\\ndescriptions off, selected\\nCaptions\\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\\ncaptions off, selected\\nAudio Track\\nen (Main), selected\\nQuality Levels\\n1080p1080pHD\\n720p720pHD\\n540p540p\\n360p360p\\n270p270p\\nAutoA, selected\\nFullscreen\\nThis is a modal window.\\nBeginning of dialog window.

The Coca-Cola-owned sports drink created an ad with Full Contact Advertising called “Field of Fake,” in which creepy visuals showcased all the ways that AI doesn’t understand how to create realistic advertising. Sports drinks were depicted as neon goo snakes defying the laws of physics, while human bodies bulged and undulated like a psychedelic nightmare.\\nVideo Player is loading.\\nPlay Video\\nPlay\\nMute\\nCurrent Time\\xa00:00\\n/\\nDuration\\xa00:00\\nLoaded: 0%\\n0:00\\nStream Type\\xa0LIVE\\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\\nRemaining Time\\xa0-0:00\\nShare\\n1x\\nPlayback Rate\\nChapters\\nChapters\\nDescriptions\\ndescriptions off, selected\\nCaptions\\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\\ncaptions off, selected\\nEnglish\\nAudio Track\\nen (Main), selected\\nQuality Levels\\nFullscreen\\nThis is a modal window.\\nBeginning of dialog window.

It also tied into a larger message that fits Bodyarmor market position. The ad made note of how artificial is anathema, before explaining how its drinks use “real” ingredients. It was a play on the word “artificial” that made its point in a culturally relevant way.\\nInterestingly, Coca-Cola has leaned way into AI marketing for its core beverage, and even ran its first batch of AI-generated TV ads in November. The creative unsurprisingly sparked some controversy, and even inspired another all-natural drink brand to fire a shot at Coca-Cola in response.\\nAlso read: Inside Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated TV ads\\nNo. 3: Klarna cuts agency expenses by 25% using AI\\nIn May, Klarna said the thing that many advertisers have been fearing since the onset of generative AI: a significant cut in agency expenses. The buy now, pay later brand announced that its use of AI had resulted in a 25% reduction in these costs, saving it around $10 million over the course of the year. Klarna said that AI had been swapped for agencies with respect to translation, production, CRM and social work, and was being deployed for about 80% of its copywriting.\\nMost other brands using AI have yet to find this much success, but fears in the production industry are mounting, and for anyone who says that AI isn’t replacing advertising jobs, Klarna is one of the clearest pieces of evidence suggesting otherwise. Indeed, some 30,000 advertising roles may be automated by 2030, according to Forrester.\\nAgencies need not see this as a harbinger of doomsday. Speaking with Ad Age in September, Klarna Chief Marketing Officer David Sandstrom said that generative AI plays a big part in campaigns around annual retail events such as back to school, but that larger campaigns “are still going to be 100% human.” This means that now more than ever, agencies need to be clear about how they can help brands, especially with the kinds of tasks that are too sensitive or high-stakes to be left up to computer technology.\\nNo. 2: ProCreate saying ‘No’ to AI\\nWhile numerous brands were publicly embracing AI, design platform ProCreate took the opposite stance.\\n“I really [bleep] hate generative AI,” CEO James Cuda said in a video posted to X. “I don’t like what’s happening in the industry and I don’t like what it’s doing to artists.”\\nWe’re never going there. Creativity is made, not generated.\\nYou can read more at https://t.co/9Fgh460KVu ✨ #procreate #noaiart pic.twitter.com/AnLVPgWzl3\\n— Procreate (@Procreate) August 18, 2024\\nCuda, speaking on behalf of ProCreate, formally declared that the company would not introduce AI into its products. This may seem an odd selection for a “best AI activations” list, but the video brought significant positive attention to ProCreate’s brand. Numerous creatives poured in their support on social media, evidently resonating with the anti-AI stance.\\nMoreover, the supporters also shamed ProCreate’s biggest competitor, Adobe, claiming that the design giant doesn’t care about its clientele. It’s unclear whether or how the backlash affected Adobe’s business or reputation, but it certainly highlighted a growing divide in the creative community, which ProCreate was able to turn into a brand-building moment.\\nNo. 1: A fake Volvo ad makes a big mark\\nThis year’s best AI marketing activation did not come from a brand, an agency or even officially on behalf of a company. The effort was made by a solo colorist named Laszlo Gaal, who used AI to develop a mock Volvo ad. With the help of text-to-video platform Runway, Gaal depicted a lifelike vehicle speeding through a city and painting it with lush vegetation—evoking the spirit of Volvo’s actual philanthropic fund, Volvo For Life.\\nVideo Player is loading.\\nPlay Video\\nPlay\\nMute\\nCurrent Time\\xa00:00\\n/\\nDuration\\xa00:00\\nLoaded: 0%\\n0:00\\nStream Type\\xa0LIVE\\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\\nRemaining Time\\xa0-0:00\\nShare\\n1x\\nPlayback Rate\\nChapters\\nChapters\\nDescriptions\\ndescriptions off, selected\\nCaptions\\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\\ncaptions off, selected\\nAudio Track\\nQuality Levels\\nFullscreen\\nThis is a modal window.\\nBeginning of dialog window.

Many in the comments were skeptical that Gaal had used AI to create the realistic film, but the colorist assured Ad Age that he had, claiming that the final 45 AI-generated frames of the spot were distilled from a much larger collection of 500 generations.\\nGaal’s work speaks to the way that AI has democratized high-quality production for many creatives. The consequences of this may be scary for some brands—after all, Volvo never gave permission to Gaal to recreate its products in a fake ad—but those willing to listen might find some serious wisdom to learn. Gaal shared some of this with Ad Age, such as the importance of letting go of the vast majority of the assets you create and abstaining from using AI to depict brand products.\\nGaal also gave some advice for marketers who are as inundated as ever by the flow of new platforms into the AI market. Just as communicating with different kinds of people warrants different ways of speaking, leveraging different AI tools requires different styles of prompting.\\n“Whenever a new tool comes out, you have to re-learn how to talk to that tool,” Gaal said.\\nBecome an All Access subscriber\\nGet access to exclusive resources including Leading National Advertisers, World’s Largest Advertisers, Agency Report, Agency Review Tracker and TV Pricing Report.\\nClick here\\nIn this article:\\nAd Tech\\nAI\\nAutomotive\\nBest of 2024\\nBeverages\\nDigital Marketing & Ad Tech News\\nPackaged Food\\nTechnology\\nAsa Hiken\\nAsa Hiken is a technology reporter for Ad Age covering Web3, AI and other emerging spaces.\\nFollow View all articles by this author\\nMost Popular\\nIPG sells Huge to private equity firm\\nGoodby Silverstein & Partners lays off staff amid Comcast account changes\\nThe biggest brand fails of 2024\\nWHAT TO READ NEXT\\n#### The best loyalty program marketing of 2024\\n#### The top 5 creator-brand partnerships of 2024\\n#### The 25 best ads of 2024\\n#### Top account reviews of 2024\\n#### 5 of the best B2B campaigns in 2024\\n#### 5 of the best Gen Z marketing strategies in 2024\\n#### 8 of 2024’s best retail media strategies\\n#### The best purpose-driven ads of 2024\\nJoin Us\\nSubscribe Now\\nRenew\\nGet Datacenter\\nFooter Links\\nCopyright © 1994-2024\\nCrain Communications\\nPrivacy Statement\\nTerms of Use\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertise\\nReprints\\nHelp Desk\\nAd Choices\\nCareers at Crain\\nPrivacy Request\\nSister Publication Links\\nAd Age\\nCreativity\\nAmp\\nDatacenter\\nResources\\nEvents\\nOn the Move\\nLatest Issue\\nNewsletters\\nContact Us\\nSections\\nMarketing\\nAdvertising\\nDigital\\nMedia\\nAgency\\nData\\nPublishing Partner\\nStudio 30 Interactive Reports\\nVideo\\nThe top 5 most creative brand ideas you need to know about right now\\nFeatured\\nAd Age Small Agency Awards\\nBest Places to Work\\nLeading Women\\nAmerica's Hottest Brands\\nAgency Report\\nLeading National Advertisers\\nPodcasts\\nNewsletters\\nTV's most expensive shows\\nBlogs\\n2024 Summer Olympics\\nCannes Lions\\nAd spending data\\nAI and marketing\\nCreativity\\nLayoffs and budget cuts\\nMedia measurement\\nUpfronts and NewFronts\\nFootball marketing\\nTwitter ad updates\\nNFTs\\nWeb3 and metaverse marketing\\nSuper Bowl News\\nSuper Bowl Ad Review\\nSuper Bowl Commercial Updates\\nSuper Bowl Ads Archive\"},\n",

It\\'s the same term, the ANA members selected the marketing word of the year in 2023, and its the shortened version of the term \"artificial intelligence\" they selected in 2017.\\nThe ANA said 65% of members participating in the survey conducted Nov. 18 to Dec. 2, selected \"AI.\" The No. 2 selection, \"personalization,\" drew 14% of the votes, and also was the ANA\\'s word of the year in 2019.\\n\"Marketers who voted for AI shared compelling reasons for their choice, highlighting the technology’s pervasive influence,\" the ANA said in a statement, citing the following verbatim responses from anonymous members:\\n“Nothing has affected the world of marketing in 2024 more than AI.\"\\n\"AI is all over! No matter when and where, AI always comes up when talking about marketing.\"\\n\"AI has 100% become a part of our everyday work life. No exceptions.\"\\n\"It\\'s everywhere! Flooding the feeds and a hot topic of conversation that I think we are all a little scared by, intrigued and have so much to learn to help enable our work and lives.\"\\n\"AI is becoming prevalent in all our tech stacks, tools, and essentially every app we use.\"\\n\"AI and its potential to change how we work as marketers has been all the buzz.

Highlighting the key moments in ... [+] 2024 that defined technology and IT.\\ngetty\\nAs 2024 draws to a close, it is evident that this year has been transformative for the tech and IT sectors. From expected significant policy shifts under President-Elect Trump’s incoming administration to groundbreaking advancements and critical challenges in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, workforce dynamics, and cloud computing, the industry has navigated both remarkable achievements and sobering realities. These developments are set to profoundly influence the trajectory of technology and innovation in the years ahead.\\nThe AI Reckoning\\nThe year began with unbridled optimism around AI. Generative AI dominated headlines as organizations raced to integrate these technologies into workflows, promising to revolutionize industries from healthcare to finance. Companies explored AI-driven solutions for automation, customer engagement, and decision-making, fueling a wave of investment and enthusiasm.\\nHowever, by midyear, skepticism tempered the fervor. Tech leaders including Elon Musk, Dario Amodei, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Sam Altman raised alarms over the reliability of AI models, ethical dilemmas, and the economic sustainability of AI-based business models. Industry warnings about AI posing a \"risk of extinction\" highlighted growing concerns. The integration of AI often fell short of lofty expectations, hindered by challenges such as algorithmic bias, hallucinations, and the escalating costs of data and computational resources.\\nMeanwhile, AI\\'s dual-edged potential in cybersecurity became increasingly apparent. On one hand, it was celebrated as a powerful tool for detecting and mitigating threats with unprecedented speed. On the other, malicious actors weaponized AI for sophisticated cyberattacks, automating phishing campaigns and identifying vulnerabilities on an unprecedented scale. With ChatGPT celebrating its second anniversary this past weekend, these developments highlighted the pressing need for strategic, regulated, and balanced approaches to AI adoption to ensure its transformative potential is harnessed responsibly.\\nCybersecurity Under Siege\\nCybersecurity reached a crisis point in 2024, with high-profile attacks eroding confidence in both the public and private sectors. In August, a cyberattack on Seattle-Tacoma International Airport exposed the fragility of critical infrastructure, causing operational disruptions that reverberated across industries and underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.\\nMORE FROMFORBES VETTED\\n### Save Up To 75% With The Best Black Friday Clothing Deals That Are Still RunningBy Jordan Thomas Forbes Staff\\n### 10 Unofficial Hoka Cyber Week Sales You Don’t Want To MissBy Alexandra Polk Contributor\\nIn July, widespread outages stemming from a failed patch update at CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, shocked the industry. This incident revealed vulnerabilities in patch management processes and served as a stark reminder of the importance of robust disaster recovery planning. The fallout spurred companies to reassess their strategies for mitigating operational risks tied to vendor dependencies.\\nAmid these challenges, compliance frameworks like CMMC 2.0 gained traction, becoming the de facto standard for organizations conducting business with the government starting in December 2024. This updated framework represents a shift from traditional checkbox compliance to proactive, threat-aligned defense strategies. As the deadline approached, organizations began embracing these measures as essential not only for regulatory adherence but also for safeguarding against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\\nPolicy And Regulation: Anticipating A New Era Under Trump\\nAs President-Elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025, speculation is mounting about significant regulatory shifts that could impact the tech industry. His incoming administration is expected to prioritize efforts to curtail the dominance of Big Tech monopolies, signaling a renewed focus on fostering competition and addressing antitrust concerns.\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is undergoing a leadership transition following the departure of Jen Easterly, raising questions about the future direction of cybersecurity strategy in the public sector. Early indications suggest that the administration may streamline the mission of CISA, relax AI regulations to encourage innovation while balancing concerns about national security.\\nProminent industry figures such as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are advocating for government efficiency initiatives, leveraging technologies like automation and blockchain to streamline public-sector operations. These efforts could push the boundaries of traditional strategies and potentially reshape how technology is integrated into government functions.\\nThe Cloud\\'s Moment Of Truth\\nCloud computing, a pillar of modern technology, experienced both growth and growing pains in 2024. The Broadcom-VMware acquisition in April was a landmark deal, signaling consolidation in the managed services and virtualization markets. It raised questions about how such consolidations would reshape innovation and pricing in the cloud space.\\nHowever, the resilience of cloud services came under scrutiny during the major outages at Microsoft and AWS in July. These disruptions laid bare the risks of over-reliance on cloud providers, reigniting discussions on multi-cloud strategies and edge computing as alternatives to centralization. As businesses increasingly depend on cloud infrastructure, 2024 underscored the importance of diversified and resilient architecture that span private, public, and edge cloud infrastructures.\\nThe Tech Layoff Surge: A Reset In Progress\\nThe tech sector faced a reckoning as a wave of layoffs swept through the industry during the summer months. Driven by a post-pandemic correction, inflationary pressures, and the rapid integration of automation, companies across sectors reevaluated workforce needs.\\nThis \"Great Tech Reset\" highlighted the vulnerabilities of cyclical employment in technology. Entire departments were restructured, and many professionals found themselves searching for new opportunities. Yet, this period of upheaval also spotlighted the importance of transferable skillsets, with many displaced workers transitioning into roles in healthcare, energy, data centers, tech consulting, software and other related industries. The reset is expected to pave the way for a more streamlined, resilient industry as companies recalibrate their priorities.\\nAI’s Impact On Data Center Availability\\nIn 2024, the rapid adoption of AI-driven workloads significantly impacted data center availability. According to JLL\\'s Data Centers 2024 Global Outlook, the growing demands of AI are expected to drive data center storage capacity from 10.1 zettabytes in 2023 to 21.0 ZB by 2027, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 18.5%. This surge in demand has led to historically low vacancy rates in major markets. For instance, CBRE reported that North American data center vacancy rates hit new lows across major markets, with Chicago\\'s vacancy rate decreasing to 2.4% from 6.7%, and Northern Virginia\\'s dropping to 0.9% from 1.8%, despite an 18% increase in inventory. The unprecedented demand for data center capacity has strained existing facilities, driving up costs and intensifying competition for limited resources.\\nThis trend underscores the critical need for innovation in data center design and energy efficiency. Companies are investing heavily in advanced cooling technologies, renewable energy solutions, and edge computing to mitigate the impact of AI-driven demand. While AI\\'s transformative potential is widely recognized, the pressure it places on infrastructure highlights the importance of sustainable strategies to balance growth with resilience in the tech ecosystem.\\nFive Key Lessons Learned\\n2024 has provided these invaluable top five lessons for the tech and IT sectors:\\nHype Cycles Are Real: The initial fervor surrounding AI reminded us that not all technological innovations deliver immediate, transformative results. Caution, realism, and measured optimism are essential when investing in emerging technologies.\\nWall Street\\'s Ripple Effects: Risky private and public equity investments, over-leveraging, and shifting interest rate policies forced many companies to restructure, demonstrating how closely financial markets influence the tech sector\\'s stability.\\nTech Jobs Are Cyclical: Employment trends in technology are inherently tied to economic conditions, innovation cycles, and global events. Companies must prioritize workforce planning that can withstand downturns while fostering long-term adaptability.\\nTransferable Skillsets Are Key: Professionals who develop versatile skills that transcend industries are better equipped to navigate disruptions and seize opportunities in a rapidly evolving job market.\\nDiversification Is Vital: From cybersecurity defenses to cloud infrastructure strategies, diversification emerged as a critical theme, emphasizing the importance of avoiding single points of failure in both operations and investments.\\nLooking Ahead To 2025 And Beyond\\nAs we transition into 2025, the tech and IT sectors stand at a critical juncture. This year has highlighted the dual nature of innovation—its ability to propel progress through AI while also creating disruption. Policymakers, businesses, and professionals must absorb these lessons, emphasizing resilience in the face of economic and geopolitical volatility, advancing sustainable practices, and reinforcing robust security measures.\\nWith measured optimism, the industry can position itself to navigate challenges and seize emerging opportunities. Yet, the looming possibility of unforeseen Black Swan events—be it a COVID-like pandemic, sudden economic shocks from interest rate adjustments, or escalating global conflicts such as the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, unrest in the Middle East, or heightened tensions over Taiwan—serves as a stark reminder of the need for agility, adaptability, and strategic foresight in an unpredictable world.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nEmil Sayegh\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

It’s everywhere and is reshaping how we live, work and shop. With tools such as ChatGPT pulling in 207 million monthly users and Google’s AI Overviews subtly stealing clicks, marketing is standing on the precipice of its biggest upheaval yet.\\nForget the “evolution” talk—AI is here to dominate. The next two decades will demand that marketers rewrite their playbooks or risk getting left in the dust.\\nThe next 5 years: from SEO strategies to ecosystem hacking\\nGoodbye, search engines. Hello, solution engines. Over the next five years, platforms such as Google won’t just help users find answers; they’ll be the answers. Google’s AI Overviews already spoon-feed searchers so effectively that about 60% of searches now end with zero clicks. Combine that with features such as in-platform shopping and AI Overviews ads, and many users won’t even bother leaving the ecosystem to visit your brand’s site within the next few years.\\nAd Age Tech Power List 2025\\nWe’re looking for top digital innovators from agencies, brands, platforms, ad tech companies and tech startups\\nenter here\\nFor marketers, this means shifting from traditional SEO strategies to ecosystem hacking. You’ll need to optimize for AI-driven interfaces, where being discoverable inside a platform trumps owning external real estate. And let’s not forget the ethical landmines. AI tracks users like a bloodhound on a scent, but where’s the line between personalized experiences and digital stalking? Expect heated debates—and lawsuits—over how far is too far when it comes to mining data.\\nIn 10 years: The platform is the funnel\\nFast-forward to 2034, and marketing funnels as we know them will be relics of the past. AI-driven platforms will become one-stop shops that guide users from awareness to purchase without requiring a single tab switch. Think of it as Amazon’s \"Buy Now\" button, but across every platform and product imaginable.\\nHere’s the catch: AI platforms won’t nurture loyalty. They’ll make conversions stupidly easy, but keeping customers engaged post-sale? That’ll fall squarely on your shoulders. Companies will need robust, non-platform-dependent loyalty programs. Forget bland email campaigns. Instead, think AI-enhanced experiences that blend exclusivity with genuine human connection.\\nCreativity will also hit warp speed. AI tools will handle the grunt work of content creation—writing copy, designing visuals and even editing videos. Marketers, freed from the mundane, will focus on the big stuff: storytelling, strategy and emotional resonance.\\nMore from Ad Age\\nThe best AI marketing activations of 2024\\nAsa Hiken\\n7 AI tools agencies are embracing right now\\nEwan Larkin\\nHow OpenAI’s marketing ambitions could play out\\nAsa Hiken\\nIn 20 years: An AI-dominated world\\nBy 2044, AI won’t just be a tool; it will be the backbone of society. The kids glued to their iPads today will grow up expecting brands to anticipate their every need, mood and desire. The bar for personalization will skyrocket, and if you’re not delivering hyper-relevant, real-time experiences? Forget it.\\nPicture this: You’re walking downtown and your AI assistant chimes in: “Three stores nearby are running sales on those sneakers you liked online, and the best price is a five-minute walk away.” AI will connect every digital breadcrumb you’ve ever left—location data, purchase history and even your heart rate — to curate moments that feel eerily perfect.\\nFor marketers, this means a relentless demand for transparency and authenticity. Consumers will see right through AI-driven gimmicks, and trust will become your most valuable currency. If your brand doesn’t have a soul, you’re doomed.\\nSo how do you stay ahead when AI is poised to eat your lunch? It boils down to three don\\'ts:\\nNextGen Marketing Summit\\nJoin us for a crash course on Gen Z, DTC marketing and the creator economy\\nRegister today\\nDon’t lose your humanity\\nWhile AI can handle personalized messaging at scale, it’s the human touch that makes the difference. For example, Spotify’s “Wrapped” campaign uses AI to analyze user listening habits, but it’s the clever copy and playful tone that resonate with audiences. AI provides the data, but it’s Spotify’s brand voice that turns it into an emotional, shareable experience. Similarly, ensure your AI-driven efforts don’t feel robotic—use them to enhance, not replace, genuine brand storytelling.\\nDon’t stagnate\\nStaying ahead requires experimentation with emerging tools. Sephora adopted AI-powered virtual try-ons, enabling customers to see how products look in real time using augmented reality. By piloting these features early, Sephora captured attention and set a new standard for e-commerce engagement. Don’t wait for trends to become mainstream; allocate resources to explore them early to differentiate your brand now.\\nDon’t abandon creativity\\nEven with AI in the mix, creativity remains your superpower. Coca-Cola\\'s “Masterpiece” campaign blends classic art with modern AI technology to create dynamic visuals that captivate audiences. The campaign used AI to seamlessly integrate iconic artworks into contemporary settings, showcasing the brand\\'s creativity and innovation. AI refined the execution, but the big idea and emotional resonance are undeniably human. Use AI to streamline production, but keep your team focused on crafting boundary-pushing concepts.\\nOver the next 20 years, AI will reshape marketing into something faster and smarter (and maybe even a little unsettling). But AI isn’t replacing creativity; it’s enabling it. So, stop clutching your pearls over AI taking your job and learn how to wield it better than the competition. In the end, the future of marketing isn’t about AI or humans—it’s about both working together to make magic.\\nA-List & Creativity Awards\\nEnter for a chance to be recognized as the best in advertising\\nSubmit your entry here\\nIn this article:\\nAd Tech\\nAI\\nDigital Marketing & Ad Tech News\\nMarketing News & Strategy\\nOpinion\\nTechnology\\nShawn Denney\\nShawn Denney is a growth strategist at\\xa0digital marketing agency Intero Digital.\\nView all articles by this author\\nMost Popular\\nIPG sells Huge to private equity firm\\nGoodby Silverstein & Partners lays off staff amid Comcast account changes\\nThe biggest brand fails of 2024\\nWHAT TO READ NEXT\\n#### DEI and business success—why inclusion is key to innovation and growth\\n#### Gen Z is redefining life-stage marketing—how brands can catch up\\n#### Election 2024—key takeaways from the $11 billion battle\\n#### How Gen Z is reshaping agency workplace culture\\n#### Unhinged marketing—how brands can get weird in their advertising\\n#### How to drive creativity and spark brand success\\n#### Holiday marketing—how brands can target motivated shoppers this season\\n#### What OpenAI\\'s autonomous agent could mean for the creative industry\\nJoin Us\\nSubscribe Now\\nRenew\\nGet Datacenter\\nFooter Links\\nCopyright © 1994-2024\\nCrain Communications\\nPrivacy Statement\\nTerms of Use\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertise\\nReprints\\nHelp Desk\\nAd Choices\\nCareers at Crain\\nPrivacy Request\\nSister Publication Links\\nAd Age\\nCreativity\\nAmp\\nDatacenter\\nResources\\nEvents\\nOn the Move\\nLatest Issue\\nNewsletters\\nContact Us\\nSections\\nMarketing\\nAdvertising\\nDigital\\nMedia\\nAgency\\nData\\nPublishing Partner\\nStudio 30 Interactive Reports\\nVideo\\nThe top 5 most creative brand ideas you need to know about right now\\nFeatured\\nAd Age Small Agency Awards\\nBest Places to Work\\nLeading Women\\nAmerica\\'s Hottest Brands\\nAgency Report\\nLeading National Advertisers\\nPodcasts\\nNewsletters\\nTV\\'s most expensive shows\\nBlogs\\n2024 Summer Olympics\\nCannes Lions\\nAd spending data\\nAI and marketing\\nCreativity\\nLayoffs and budget cuts\\nMedia measurement\\nUpfronts and NewFronts\\nFootball marketing\\nTwitter ad updates\\nNFTs\\nWeb3 and metaverse marketing\\nSuper Bowl News\\nSuper Bowl Ad Review\\nSuper Bowl Commercial Updates\\nSuper Bowl Ads Archive'},\n",

       "   'raw_content': 'News\\nPipe strengthens leadership team with four key appointments\\nPipe, the California-based capital platform, has appointed four new leaders, including a chief technology officer (CTO) and chief product officer (CPO).\\nPipe announces four new leaders\\nNate Wiger has been named as CTO; Claurelle Rakipovic as CPO; Amy Loh as chief marketing officer (CMO); and Jon Lear as global head of growth.\\n“Rakipovic, Wiger, Loh and Lear will further accelerate Pipe’s mission to scale globally, expand the embedded financial suite of products, and reach more SMBs through global partners,” explains a company statement.\\nWiger brings 25 years of experience in the tech sector, most recently serving a five-year tenure as VP of Intuit.

The most common reason cited was a lack of suitable candidates. From the prospective employee’s perspective, ‘undesirable working conditions’ were listed as the greatest concern.\\nAustralian employment website SEEK says there is tightness in the labour market, but only just. The company reveals its list of the five trends that will shape work in the year ahead.\\n1. There industries that are growing\\nIf you are a part of the care economy, an IT professional, or a truck driver, you are going to see continued growth in 2025.\\n“The number of older Australians continues to grow, alongside an increasing awareness of mental health and behavioural conditions- driving an ongoing demand for care workers. This is unlikely to end anytime soon,” says Blair Chapman, SEEK’s senior economist.\\nRegistered nurses, aged and disabled carers and child carers will be in hot demand. 2025 will bring strong demand in Information & Communication Technology, Transport & Logistics, Retail & Hospitality.\\n“Employment for programmers and data scientists is likely to continue growing quickly as businesses look to keep up with the increasing use of AI by their employees, clients and competitors,” says Chapman.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nOnline shopping is also driving growth in the digital arena, is online shopping.\\n“The use of online delivery services will continue to drive demand for workers in the logistics sector, so it is likely that demand for truck drivers and warehouse staff like store persons and forklift drivers will remain elevated in 2025.”\\nKeep an eye on: “A stabilisation of job ad volumes in 2025. As a leading indicator, ad volumes should stabilise ahead of the RBA’s expected leveling off of the unemployment rate in mid to late 2025.”\\n2. Use AI to give your résumé a glow-up\\nUsing AI to write or refine your resume is becoming commonplace.\\n“SEEK data shows that the number of AI-generated resumes submitted to the platform grew from 10% in July 2023 to 25% in June 2024, and around half of all resumes are expected to be created with the support of AI in the coming months. But if used responsibly, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” says Grant Wright, a SEEK AI executive.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nWright cautions job seekers not to lean too heavily on AI, however.\\n“When used appropriately, AI can enhance resumes and job applications by refining ideas and helping candidates showcase their best selves. But it’s important that job seekers maintain control over their content and ensure it remains true to who they are. Relying too heavily on AI risks losing personal touch, making it harder to stand out and challenging for employers to trust the authenticity of the information provided,” says Wright.\\nKeep an eye on: “AI’s ability to understand unstructured text, image, video and voice content will enable new interaction modes and experiences that help candidates and hirers better express what they are looking for.”\\n3. Select better candidates\\nJust as artificial intelligence can help generate a strong resume, it can also aid when hirers have to sift through a large amount of resume submissions.\\n“In the current cost-conscious environment, with a relatively tight labour market and extremely high application volumes, the time and effort that goes into the recruitment process is an increasingly crucial problem to solve for most hirers,” says Simon Lusted, a SEEK product executive.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\n“From writing the job ad, to salary benchmarking, shortlisting candidates and following up. Our focus is on reducing friction, or hold-ups, when hiring, and in surfacing good candidates in real time, reducing the lag between deciding to hire and making an offer.”\\nKeep an eye on: “AI supporting both sides of the hiring process, but importantly, increasingly improving the outcomes for both hirers and candidates – with better matches made faster.”\\n4. Build culture\\nStriving to make work a somewhat enjoyable endeavour pays dividends in retention and productivity.\\n“Connection between teams, as well as within teams, is valuable for both the business and for its people,” says Kathleen McCudden, a SEEK people & culture\\xa0executive. “Activities such as social committees, informal learning and ideation sessions, and joint projects that encourage cross-functional collaboration are just some examples of initiatives to help drive deeper connections across teams.”\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nBuilding culture can be difficult when teams are working remotely.\\n“Fostering connection among employees remains a challenge for many companies working with hybrid and geographically disparate teams. We’ve learnt that distributed teams can work effectively together, but it requires deliberate effort to build rapport and foster a sense of belonging amongst people,” says McCudden.\\nKeep an eye on: “Balancing the needs of an individual, the team, and the organisation in fostering a sustainable and flexible work environment, which enables a strong connection amongst people.”\\n5.

Tomorrow’s game-changers in cloud computing are already here – they’re just not evenly distributed yet.\\nBy OLEG GOHMAN\\nDECEMBER 9, 2024 02:10\\nArtificial intelligence\\n(photo credit: INGIMAGE)\\nRemember when cloud computing was just about storage and scalability? Those days are gone. In 2024, we’re witnessing a seismic shift in how cloud technology shapes our digital world, with AI at the forefront of this transformation. From quantum breakthroughs to multi-cloud complexities, the landscape has been redefined.\\nLet’s dive into the trends fundamentally changing business operations in the cloud era.\\nIf 2023 was the year AI went mainstream, 2024 is when it became the backbone of cloud computing. We’re seeing entire enterprises reimagined through AI-powered services.\\nThis transformation is particularly fascinating because it’s democratizing advanced AI capabilities and large language models for GenAI. Small start-ups can now access the same powerful AI tools that were once the exclusive domain of tech giants. This shift has led to AI-first architectures that optimize usage automatically, cloud services that predict and prevent operational issues, and hybrid systems blending human expertise with AI insights.\\nThe game-changer? These AI capabilities are now cost-effective, reaching organizations of all sizes.\\nArtificial intelligence (credit: INGIMAGE)\\nThe silent revolution in running code\\nThe days of meticulously managing servers are becoming as outdated as dial-up Internet. In 2024, serverless computing has evolved into an essential strategy, transforming how businesses approach infrastructure.\\nMedia streaming companies, for instance, handle millions of users with zero manual infrastructure management, scaling automatically during peaks and vanishing during downtimes. Key advances include pay-per-millisecond pricing models; reducing costs by up to 70%; instantaneous traffic scaling by cloud vendors; and zero-maintenance DBaaS (Database as a Service) with rapid scaling based on demand.\\nCybersecurity: The new arms race\\nCloud-based cyberattacks surged 48% in early 2024, but cloud security has also advanced. How? By evolving from reactive to predictive, with intelligent systems that learn and adapt. Transformative developments include AI-powered detection of anomalies in real-time; Mainstream adoption of quantum-resistant encryption, and Zero-trust architectures that treat all requests as potentially hostile.\\nFrom compromise to strategic advantage\\nStay updated with the latest news!\\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\\nSubscribe Now\\nThe hybrid cloud story of 2024 is about strategic advantage, not compromise. Organizations are finding that hybrid models aren’t just stepping stones but often optimal end states. Microservices adoption has revolutionized software consumption, shifting from rigid contracts to pure usage-based models. Successful transformations this year have come from companies embracing hybrid flexibility, combining pay-per-use benefits with robust infrastructure. What was once a one-way journey to the cloud is now a dynamic, value-driven operation.\\nManaging multiple clouds was once chaotic, but 2024 has introduced tools that make this complexity manageable. Think of having a universal remote that controls and optimizes your entire cloud ecosystem.\\nThe cloud’s next frontier\\nQuantum computing in the cloud might sound like science fiction, but in 2024, it’s becoming a science fact. While we haven’t achieved quantum supremacy, cloud providers are making quantum capabilities accessible in ways that were unimaginable just a year ago.\\nWhat makes this particularly exciting is how cloud platforms democratize access to quantum computing, allowing organizations to experiment with quantum algorithms without investing in quantum hardware.\\nThe cloud in 2025 and beyond\\nThe cloud is no longer just infrastructure but a driver of business innovation. Successful companies in 2024 are those transformed by cloud technologies. Looking forward, we’re seeing early signs of:\\n• On-demand LLM, both commercial and open-source\\n• AI-driven visual tools for cloud infrastructure management\\n• Cloud-native AI-based security services\\n• The integration of edge computing with traditional cloud\\n• Quantum-classical hybrid systems becoming viable\\nEmbracing the new cloud reality\\nIn conclusion, 2024 has taught us that the cloud is no longer about “if” or “when” – it’s about “how well.” Organizations that understand this and adapt accordingly aren’t just surviving; they’re thriving in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\\nThe key to success in this new landscape isn’t just adopting the latest technologies – it’s about understanding how these technologies can transform your business. As we move forward, the question isn’t whether to embrace these changes, but how to leverage them for maximum impact.\\nThe cloud of 2024 is more than a technology platform, it’s a business transformation engine. For those ready to embrace it, the possibilities are endless. Remember, tomorrow’s game-changers in cloud computing are already here – they’re just not evenly distributed yet.\\nThe writer is chief technology officer at CloudZone.\\nRelated Tags\\ntechnology\\nArtificial intelligence\\nAI\\nFuture\\nHot Opinion\\n### Syria’s collapse: An opportunity and a risk for Israel\\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\\n### For every bright moment there is a dark lining\\nBy URI PILICHOWSKI\\n### Hypocrisy and deception: The gender segregation bill\\nBy URI REGEV\\n### Grapevine December 8, 2024: A suitable match\\nBy GREER FAY CASHMAN\\n### Israel feels like it\\'s falling apart - to move forward, accountability must be taken\\nBy YAAKOV KATZ\\nMost Read\\n1 ### The toppling of Assad\\'s regime in Syria may be bad news for Israel\\n2 ### An IDF reservist\\'s top ten takeaways after returning from Gaza\\n3 ### Russia warns the United States of the risks of World War Three\\n4 ### My decision was made, I will watch the Iranian missile attack\\n5 ### \\'Antisemitic nightmare at Fontainebleau Miami beach,\\' says Rabbi Shmuley\\nAdvertisement\\nInformation\\nAbout Us\\nContact us\\nFeedback\\nTerms Of Service\\nPrivacy Policy\\nSubscriber Agreement\\nJPost Jobs\\nCancel Subscription\\nSitemap\\nCustomer Service\\nJP Store\\nAdvertise with Us\\nפרסום בג\\'רוזלם פוסט\\nThe Jerusalem Post Group\\nBreaking News\\nWorld News\\nIran News\\nMDA Heroes\\nThe Jerusalem Report\\nJerusalem Post Lite\\nReal Estate Listings\\nServices\\nPrecious Metals\\nTools and services\\nJPost Premium\\nUlpan Online\\nJPost Newsletter\\nOur Magazines\\nLearn Hebrew\\nRSS feed\\nJPost.com Archive\\nDigital Library\\nLists of Jewish holidays\\nלוח חגים ומועדים 2024\\nזמני כניסת שבת\\nחדשות מעריב\\nSites Of Interest\\nPoalim Online\\nJNF-USA\\nThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be contacted with any questions or requests:\\nTelephone: *2421 * Extension 4 Jerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com\\nThe center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM and 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM and 12:30 PM\\nFor international customers: The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll Free number 1-800-448-9291 Telephone +972-3-761-9056 Fax: 972-3-561-3699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com\\nCopyright © 2024 Jpost Inc.

The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down.\\nPhoto Credit: Bloomberg\\nAt this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024.\\nTo keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today.\\nInterestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions.\\nAnd keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month!\\nPrediction 1: Nvidia will dramatically ramp up its efforts to become a cloud provider.\\nOutcome: Right\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### FBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Change WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal Apps\\n### What To Know About The UnitedHealthcare CEO Murder—As NYPD Releases New Photos Of Suspect\\n### iOS 18.2 Release Date: iPhone’s New Upgrade Is Hours Away\\nNvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow.\\nFor now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course.\\nNvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia.\\nIt will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead.\\nPrediction 2: Stability AI will shut down.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nThings went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April.\\nIt seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true.\\nBut the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors.\\nThe Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern.\\nPrediction 3: The terms “large language model” and “LLM” will become less common.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nAt least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here.\\nIn a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote:\\n“It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.”\\nWe agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models.\\nBut the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology.\\nPrediction 4: The most advanced closed models will continue to outperform the most advanced open models by a meaningful margin.\\nOutcome: Right\\nThe release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing.\\nThen OpenAI dropped o1.\\no1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research.\\nIn his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.”\\nBefore o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference.\\nBecause it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead.\\nIt is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance.\\nThis is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year:\\n“As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.”\\nPrediction 5: A number of Fortune 500 companies will create a new C-suite position: Chief AI Officer.\\nOutcome: Right\\nIn 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts.\\nConsidering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025.\\nPrediction 6: An alternative to the transformer architecture will see meaningful adoption.\\nOutcome: Right\\nThe transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.”\\nThat alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM).\\nMamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture.\\nCartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs.\\n(Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.)\\nPrediction 7: Strategic investments from cloud providers into AI startups—and the associated accounting implications—will be challenged by regulators.\\nOutcome: Right\\nHyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year.\\nThe FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic.\\nRegulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared.\\nThese regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.”\\nPrediction 8: The Microsoft/OpenAI relationship will begin to fray.\\nOutcome: Right\\nA steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”)\\nOpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer.\\nOther sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief.\\nPrediction 9: Some of the hype and herd mentality behavior that shifted from crypto to AI in 2023 will shift back to crypto in 2024.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nWe wrote in last December’s predictions article:\\n“Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.”\\nThis has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started.\\nSo why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening.\\nPrediction 10: At least one U.S. court will rule that generative AI models trained on the internet represent a violation of copyright. The issue will begin working its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nNearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation.\\nBut a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases.\\nIn other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move.\\nBut substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.\\nSee here for the original article with our 2024 AI predictions.\\nSee here for our 2023 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nSee here for our 2022 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nSee here for our 2021 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter.\\nRob Toews\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

For leaders, this transformation presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Adopting a mindset that embraces continuous innovation is key to overcoming the challenge. AI offers leaders a powerful tool and partner for navigating change, uncovering growth opportunities, and building a future-ready workforce. Those who develop a human centric approach to AI will drive innovation and expand their personal brand.\\nLeaders who thrive in this environment will move beyond technical knowledge and focus on cultivating a strategic approach to AI integration. Doing so involves leveraging AI to drive better decisions, fostering a culture of adaptability, and preparing their teams to fully embrace its potential. Here\\'s how to get started.\\nUse AI To Enhance Decision-Making And Uncover Growth Opportunities\\nChatGPT and other generative AI tools offer leaders unparalleled insights into operations, markets, and customer needs. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, AI-powered tools enable leaders to make more informed decisions faster and with greater precision. McKinsey reports that 65% of organizations now regularly use generative AI in at least one business function.\\n\"AI is profoundly reshaping leadership strategies, transforming them from reactive to anticipatory models,\" says Amit Varma, President of Global Markets at Brillio. \"Leaders now leverage AI to enhance decision-making precision and drive operational efficiencies at an unprecedented scale.\" Beyond operational improvements, AI can help uncover entirely new revenue streams by identifying untapped markets or creating innovative services. To fully harness this potential, leaders should invest in data governance frameworks that ensure accuracy and consistency to lay the groundwork for AI to deliver actionable insights.\\nCultivate An AI Mindset That Embraces Continuous Learning And Adaptability\\nLifelong learning is essential for all employees in a rapidly evolving environment. Leaders need to double down on their growth mindset. Traditional leadership models, which often emphasize static expertise are no longer relevant and need to be replaced with approaches that value curiosity, experimentation, and adaptability. Leaders who cultivate data literacy and technological fluency can confidently navigate AI\\'s complexities.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### KG Of VCHA Exits Girl Group With Lawsuit Against JYP USA Alleging Child Labor Abuse\\n### FBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Change WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal Apps\\n### Horror Hit ‘Heretic’ Arrives On Digital Streaming This Week\\nThis focus on learning also involves recognizing AI as a complement to human ingenuity rather than a replacement for it. For example, AI tools can augment creativity by generating ideas or automating routine tasks, freeing teams to focus on strategic and innovative activities. McKinsey\\'s latest survey reveals that AI delivers meaningful revenue increases—like over 5% gains in supply chain and inventory management—and drives cost efficiencies in areas like service operations and human resources. By cultivating a culture that celebrates learning and experimentation, leaders can create an environment where AI is seen not as a disruptor but as an enabler of progress.\\nPrioritize Workforce Readiness To Fully Leverage AI\\nThe success of AI adoption depends not only on the technology itself but also on the people who use it. Building a workforce that is both AI-literate and open to technological change is essential for any organization looking to thrive in the digital age.\\nLeaders can start by providing training programs that demystify AI and equip employees with the skills to use it effectively. This could include workshops on data interpretation, hands-on experience with AI tools, or even cross-functional collaborations that encourage knowledge sharing.\\nCreating a culture of openness to change is key. When teams understand the value of AI and see its benefits firsthand, resistance will likely. Leaders can further foster this openness by celebrating milestones and acknowledging employees who embrace AI-driven initiatives, making innovation a shared organizational priority.\\nLead With Confidence In An AI-Powered Future\\nIt seems ironic that one of the biggest tech advances in our lifetime -AI- is having its greatest effect on leadership by offering new ways to drive innovation, make better decisions, and build teams that are poised for a tech-driven future. Successful integration requires a mindset shift, a commitment to continuous learning, and a clear strategy for workforce empowerment.\\nAs you reflect on your leadership journey, consider how you can leverage artifical intelligence to adapt to change and drive it. The leaders of tomorrow will be those who embrace AI as a catalyst for growth, guiding their organizations with vision, agility, and confidence.

So it just made sense for the fourth edition of the Red Sea International Film Festival (RSIFF) to put a spotlight on AI in during a Sunday panel at its market, the Red Sea Souk.\\n“Can AI be a creative partner?” was the title of the session held as part of another full day of activities in\\xa0Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The panel, moderated by Saudi businesswoman and AI expert Fatmah Baothman, featured Chris Jacquemin, partner and head of digital strategy at WME, Diana Williams, CEO and co-founder of Kinetic Energy Entertainment, and Jennifer Howell, chief creative officer at Deep Voodoo, the AI and deepfake video company of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. And it explored the opportunities and challenges of AI, how it may affect creative jobs, and how AI is currently being used in the entertainment industry.\\nRelated Stories\\nMovies\\nOlivia Wilde Sees Social Media as a Danger for Film as Art: \"I Don\\'t Make Movies So People Love Them\"\\nMovies\\nMBC Studios, Telfaz11 Form Strategic Partnership to \"Champion Saudi Stories\"\\nJacquemin mentioned that the public hasn’t really seen any major AI movies from Hollywood released so far. “The interest from studios has gone up a lot over the past year,” Howell said though. “We have met with all the studios. We are doing productions with a handful of them.” Everyone is still in the earlier stages of trying to figure out how to use it though, she concluded.\\nDeep Voodo, which two years ago raised $20 million, has used its technology for such content as YouTube series Sassy Justice and a Kendrick Lamar music video. Deepfakes use AI and machine learning to replace faces on characters. In Sassy Justice, the technology was used to parody Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg, among others. And for Apple TV+ series Before, its team took video samples of Billy Crystal’s face to digitally de-age him.\\nThe panel was overall positive on the opportunities that AI will create to speed up production processes and more tedious and technical work, freeing up time for creatives to focus on key creative decisions rather than eliminating most human jobs.\\nFor example, Howell said Deep Voodoo sees AI as “a storytelling tool used by humans for cost-effectiveness, creativity, whatever the case may be.” And Jacquemin called AI “a co-pilot tool,” sharing that WME clients are using the technology particularly “early in the creative process,” for example to create mood boards and visual ideas, or to use ChatGPT for story outlines.\\nHe said that the technology “gives you a certain set of superpowers” that can accelerate the creative process but argued that “unless somebody has an incredible artistic vision, it’s not going to end up making the movie (or any other piece of creative work) better.” He added: “I don’t necessarily believe that it is going to make works that are significantly better than what we are seeing today.”\\nSo where will AI drive job losses in Hollywood? “Actors are incredibly important,” Howell emphasized. “If you’re doing a traditional … deepfake scenario, it’s the actor who’s the puppeteer, if you will, to the puppet.”\\nHer take: “You can’t have a believable performance without an actor. Other jobs, I think, will shift” though. She mentioned similar changes to employment amid past technology advancements, such as how editors had to shift their skill sets amid the rise of digital tools. “There are going to be shifts more than a dramatic job loss,” she concluded, arguing new roles will be created amid that change. “There was no deepfake artist job five years ago,” for example, Howell highlighted.\\nEchoed Jacquemin: “There are more productions possible,” even though “there will be jobs that will be eliminated.” And he emphasized: “I think we will see AI effectively democratizing access,” highlighting: “About 20 years ago, when YouTube was created, it ultimately gave birth to an entirely new generation of storytellers.”\\nWilliams highlighted though that the economic and financial impact on industry people from the time savings due to AI are still to emerge. And she noted that IP and copyrights are so key for Hollywood giants that companies will keep them in core focus amid the rise of AI.\\n“All our movies and TV shows are done in conjunction with all licensed data,” Howell emphasized.\\nThe session started with an on-screen video showing animated speaking voices that, Baothman said, was created by using AI.\\nRead More About:\\nartificial intelligence\\ninternational\\nMatt Stone\\nRed Sea Film Festival\\nTrey Parker\\nWME\\nTHR Newsletters\\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\\nSubscribe Sign Up\\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\\nRed Sea Film Festival\\nOlivia Wilde Sees Social Media as a Danger for Film as Art: “I Don’t Make Movies So People Love Them”\\nRed Sea Film Festival\\nMBC Studios, Telfaz11 Form Strategic Partnership to “Champion Saudi Stories”\\nSelena Gomez\\nSelena Gomez Defends Herself After Eugenio Derbez Criticizes Her ‘Emilia Pérez’ Performance\\nRed Sea Film Festival\\n‘Dreaming of Lions’ Is an Absurdist Black Comedy on Euthanasia Inspired by Its Director’s Experiences\\nBehind The Screen\\nThe Peculiar VFX Magic of ‘Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’\\nThe Substance\\n‘Emilia Pérez’ Wins Big at European Film Awards\\nShopping With THR\\nThe 20+ Best DC Comics Gifts That Justice League Superfans Want for the Holidays\\nBy Rudie Obias\\nOz-Mania Continues Post-‘Wicked’ With ‘The Wizard of Oz’ 85th Anniversary Collabs\\nBy Erin Lassner\\nThe 20+ Best Gifts for Filmmakers, From Storyboard Notebooks and Camera Gear to Francis Ford Coppola’s Wine\\nBy Thomas Hindle, Danielle Directo-Meston\\nHead to Hoth Like Darth Vader with Columbia’s Latest ‘Star Wars’ Collaboration\\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\\nTHR Newsletters\\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\\nEmail Address\\nSubscribe Today Sign Up\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Human communication with robotics. Future ... [+] concept with smart robotics and artificial intelligence. 3D rendering\\ngetty\\nIt is often said that we tend to overrate the short-term impact of technology but underrate its long-term impact. This mantra is a useful reminder that there’s no need to be overly critical or negative when our expectations of progress surpass actual progress in any field of innovation, including AI.\\nSo, while there is much discussion on how AI “changes everything” when it comes to staffing, hiring, and recruitment practices, it is more accurate to say that its potential for driving fundamental improvements in this area remains significant, but that so far it is still very much a work in progress, at least when we dissect the key areas of impact, namely:\\n(1) Shifting from credentials to skills: Arguably the biggest opportunity for AI to improve both employers’ ability to find the right candidate for the right role, and increase fairness and meritocracy. Interesting, this is not so much about the how of talent identification (or the specific methods for inferring or assessing talent), but the what (redefining how we think of talent in the first place). Indeed, a logical extension of the fact that generative AI devaluates human expertise, and any hard skill related to IQ, formal knowledge, or objective problem solving capabilities, is that college credentials cease to be a central indicator of talent - and let’s face it, employers have long felt that the value of college credentials is not so much in showing what candidates have learned, but how good they are at learning, but there are much better, faster, and cheaper ways to test whether someone is curious, smart, and conscientious, than waiting for a higher educational institution to select them (or grade them on essay writing for three or four years). And yet, despite much talk about de-emphasizing credentials and college education in many jobs, roles, and organizations, there is still a premium attached to those who complete an undergraduate degree, and extra status to those who have the privilege of doing so in a highly rated academic institution. While there is little sign that universities are evolving and modernizing fast enough to adapt to the AI world, we shouldn’t bet against 200+ year old institutions that have managed to become highly coveted luxury super-brands, to the point of increasing their fees exponentially over the past few decades while offering the same or less value in objective terms. AI may not be able to change this; it’s employer demand (or lack thereof) that will.\\n(2) De-biasing assessment and increasing the accuracy of search and match: Mixed progress on this critical aspect of recruitment so far. To be sure, the general bar when it comes to making accurate inferences of candidates’ potential remains rather low: hiring managers and recruiters often favor their intuition over facts and data, and traditional hiring methods (from CV-based shortlisting, to reference checks, and the employment interview) still dominate the field despite their low reliability and validity, and propensity to elicit biases. The equivalent in the world of dating (where matchmaking is also a key goal) would be to not rely on online and mobile dating technologies to find your potential partner or perfect love match, but still rely on drunken nights out at the pub. So, it is not hard for the average employer to increase their ability to predict future candidate fit or performance, whether via simple search and match algorithms embedded in their applicant tracking systems, automated resume parsing tools, natural language processing or emotional sensing algorithms that scrape video interviews (they may seem creepy and biased, but not compared to many human interviewers), and science-based assessments that improve the candidate experience by shortening or gamifying the process. But there is a catch: organizations are often unable to measure the exact value employees contribute to their teams and organizations, so the outcome AI predicts is not actually a reliable or objective outcome in the first place. This is frustrating, since we have known for decades how to measure the quality of hire (individual job performance, productivity, turnover, engagement, organizational citizenship, etc). And yet, in highly skilled jobs, a fundamental paradox in management is that the more you get paid for doing your job, the harder it is to know if you are actually any good at it! Instead, your career success and official track record of “performance” is more dependent on your reputation, which depends largely on your ability to play the game, manage politics, and engage in the _performati_ve aspects of job performance. This is why if we train AI to predict who will get promoted in a company (which we do by training it on past organizational data), it will successfully identify traits, such as overconfidence, ambition, status-seeking, self-promotion, and low agreeableness as key attributes to select on. In other words, use AI to select your future stars and it will efficiently select politicians, not to mention those who replicate the status quo and the in-group in terms of gender, race, age, and functional background.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### KG Of VCHA Exits Girl Group With Lawsuit Against JYP USA Alleging Child Labor Abuse\\n### Horror Hit ‘Heretic’ Arrives On Digital Streaming This Week\\n### Russian Troops Attacked Ukrainian Lines In An Unarmored Van. ‘That’s How Our Heroic Cars Die.’\\n(3) Improving the candidate experience: Everybody knows it would be good to improve the candidate experience in recruitment, but there’s limited sign of progress on this over the past decade or more. So, while employers seek to give candidates “consumer-like experiences”, not least because they would benefit from hiring their passionate brand ambassadors or avid consumers in the first place, this is not quite the remit of AI, but of human recruiters and hiring managers. To be sure, AI has improved the process of hiring people on both sides: recruiters are clearly able to boost their efficiency and productivity (though by achieving the same output with less input rather than increasing their total output) and candidates are flooding companies with applications thanks to gen AI tools that enable them to send 100 perfect applications to 100 different employers in a few hours, rather than spending a full week on two or three applications. Indeed, AI hiring AI is no longer a future prospect, but a present reality. Alas, this introduces a great deal of noise and bias in the system, devaluating trust and revaluing old school methods, such as the analogue interview or an informal chat in the cafeteria, not to mention word of mouth recommendations, which lead to nepotistic appointments and harm diversity. What is clear is that the potential value of AI to improve the candidate experience and let even those who don’t succeed with their applications feel positive about a given employer (”I didn’t get the job, but loved the experience”) will not come from AI, but from the human and humane touch that AI can help to enable once it frees up hiring managers and recruiters to harness their EQ, empathy, and people-skills. This is not a given, and requires not just training, re-skilling and up-skilling, but also change management and incentivizes.\\nIn short, though recruitment today does not look radically different than recruitment five years ago, there are visible changes in the horizon. So far, it is a case of mostly running faster in the same direction, but it isn’t clear whether this is the right direction to begin with. And if we don’t know where we are going, any road will take us there.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nTomas Chamorro-Premuzic\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

Chatbots powered by AI are now at everyone's fingertips. We have seen increasing application of AI in many disciplines. Health care is also going through evolution due to the gradual incorporation of AI. It definitely offers a lot of exciting opportunities, especially for faster and more accurate diagnosis as well as precision medicine.\\nLooking back, work on AI has continued for a long time, and health care has always been a part of it. Back in the decade of the 50s and 60s', it was all about creating databases, e.g. electronic medical records and clinical information data. Such works eventually led to the launch of search engines like PubMed. Similar biomedical search engines saw a lot of growth at that time, and Ivy League universities started to use those more and more. This created a platform for enhanced collaboration among researchers.\\nThe use of AI in modern healthcare is not that uncommon. Online scheduling of appointments is an example. Evidence-based medicine, where a physician uses complete history and examination results for diagnosis and treatment is seen as the next logical step. AI can do all these faster and probably with greater accuracy than humans due to their computing powers. A study was published in the Nature journal in 2022 which looked at mammograms using AI technology. The result revealed that there was a reduction in false negatives by 9.4 per cent and false positives by 5.7 per cent. This is very promising.\\nDisease diagnosis will probably benefit immensely from AI. There are various uses of AI in the diagnosis of cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Two things stand out in this regard. First, machine learning is already assisting in workflow management and decision-making, making the entire process efficient. Second, deep learning, another aspect of AI, can leverage various data mining techniques to identify embedded patterns. Both ML and DL will be critical for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. One field where changes are already prominent is Radiology. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) is now quite common. IBM has developed a software called Avicenna, and it can scan diagnostic images and recognise abnormalities pretty well. Avicenna can also pull data from the available medical records, compare results and propose treatment options.\\nDiagnostic systems based on DL are already on the market. FDA approved Arterys, a medical imaging AI platform, in 2017, which can identify lesions, prepare reports, and present a list of potential diseases affecting the patient. There are AI systems being employed for colonoscopy and endoscopy to find out malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Data shows that DL-based technology evaluating chest X-rays can more accurately diagnose pneumonia than a human. An article in the Annals of Oncology journal (2018) presented a small dataset where AI diagnosed skin cancer more accurately than dermatologists.\\nThe speed, efficiency and specificity of lab procedures can be tremendously improved by AI. This can significantly improve detection and quantification of microorganisms, disease classification and clinical outcome analysis. Things like blood culture and sensitivity testing have been impacted very positively with rapid results, allowing the selection of proper antibiotics. Timely administration of the right antibiotic is critical to achieve the eradication of microorganisms and reduce the risk of resistance.\\nAI can be very useful in increasing the efficiency of patient flow, thereby prioritising more important patients and reducing wait time overall. This is possible with AI-driven tools designed to interact with the patients, collect data and formulate a management plan. Such real-time inputs can significantly speed up decision-making of healthcare professionals.\\nPrecision medicine should also benefit from AI. The whole concept of this approach is based on offering individualised treatment to each patient, according to their lifestyle, environment and genetic characteristics. As the speciality of AI is data mining and analysis at an extreme speed, you can imagine how efficiently we would be able to make the process. A group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology conducted a study using patients' genetic data to train ML. The system was then able to predict the response to anti-cancer drugs with a high level of success.\\nDixie B. Baker, a senior researcher in health information technology opined that with AI there will be a quicker turnout of large genetic, clinical, lifestyle and social datasets across a diverse population. Physicians will then just take a look at the screen and know what to prescribe. IBM's AI computer system Watson is a case in point. The Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina fed Watson genomic data for more than 1000 patients. The objective was to test its ability to recommend treatment for them. Their verdict was Watson could find optimal treatments faster than a human.\\nPerhaps the most widespread but overlooked use of AI in healthcare is patient education. We already have AI-based chatbots providing diet charts, lifestyle advice and behavioural therapies. Some AI-powered apps can even help with lifestyle modification, e.g. smoking cessation. This is very important because patient adherence to treatment is largely dependent on how well they understand their disease and what is required of them.\\nThough AI will inevitably become a cornerstone of healthcare, there are challenges we must be ready for. AI-based systems rely on available data, and if the quality of the data is lacking then the outcome will be similarly poor. There are also questions about data privacy and security. To ensure security, robust cybersecurity measures are required. Continuous engagement between experts and the public is also crucial for safety. Incorporating AI into the existing healthcare system also means a huge financial investment, that not everyone is prepared for.\\nAI will transform healthcare.

For leaders, this transformation presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Adopting a mindset that embraces continuous innovation is key to overcoming the challenge. AI offers leaders a powerful tool and partner for navigating change, uncovering growth opportunities, and building a future-ready workforce. Those who develop a human centric approach to AI will drive innovation and expand their personal brand.\\nLeaders who thrive in this environment will move beyond technical knowledge and focus on cultivating a strategic approach to AI integration. Doing so involves leveraging AI to drive better decisions, fostering a culture of adaptability, and preparing their teams to fully embrace its potential. Here\\'s how to get started.\\nUse AI To Enhance Decision-Making And Uncover Growth Opportunities\\nChatGPT and other generative AI tools offer leaders unparalleled insights into operations, markets, and customer needs. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, AI-powered tools enable leaders to make more informed decisions faster and with greater precision. McKinsey reports that 65% of organizations now regularly use generative AI in at least one business function.\\n\"AI is profoundly reshaping leadership strategies, transforming them from reactive to anticipatory models,\" says Amit Varma, President of Global Markets at Brillio. \"Leaders now leverage AI to enhance decision-making precision and drive operational efficiencies at an unprecedented scale.\" Beyond operational improvements, AI can help uncover entirely new revenue streams by identifying untapped markets or creating innovative services. To fully harness this potential, leaders should invest in data governance frameworks that ensure accuracy and consistency to lay the groundwork for AI to deliver actionable insights.\\nCultivate An AI Mindset That Embraces Continuous Learning And Adaptability\\nLifelong learning is essential for all employees in a rapidly evolving environment. Leaders need to double down on their growth mindset. Traditional leadership models, which often emphasize static expertise are no longer relevant and need to be replaced with approaches that value curiosity, experimentation, and adaptability. Leaders who cultivate data literacy and technological fluency can confidently navigate AI\\'s complexities.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### KG Of VCHA Exits Girl Group With Lawsuit Against JYP USA Alleging Child Labor Abuse\\n### FBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Change WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal Apps\\n### Horror Hit ‘Heretic’ Arrives On Digital Streaming This Week\\nThis focus on learning also involves recognizing AI as a complement to human ingenuity rather than a replacement for it. For example, AI tools can augment creativity by generating ideas or automating routine tasks, freeing teams to focus on strategic and innovative activities. McKinsey\\'s latest survey reveals that AI delivers meaningful revenue increases—like over 5% gains in supply chain and inventory management—and drives cost efficiencies in areas like service operations and human resources. By cultivating a culture that celebrates learning and experimentation, leaders can create an environment where AI is seen not as a disruptor but as an enabler of progress.\\nPrioritize Workforce Readiness To Fully Leverage AI\\nThe success of AI adoption depends not only on the technology itself but also on the people who use it. Building a workforce that is both AI-literate and open to technological change is essential for any organization looking to thrive in the digital age.\\nLeaders can start by providing training programs that demystify AI and equip employees with the skills to use it effectively. This could include workshops on data interpretation, hands-on experience with AI tools, or even cross-functional collaborations that encourage knowledge sharing.\\nCreating a culture of openness to change is key. When teams understand the value of AI and see its benefits firsthand, resistance will likely. Leaders can further foster this openness by celebrating milestones and acknowledging employees who embrace AI-driven initiatives, making innovation a shared organizational priority.\\nLead With Confidence In An AI-Powered Future\\nIt seems ironic that one of the biggest tech advances in our lifetime -AI- is having its greatest effect on leadership by offering new ways to drive innovation, make better decisions, and build teams that are poised for a tech-driven future. Successful integration requires a mindset shift, a commitment to continuous learning, and a clear strategy for workforce empowerment.\\nAs you reflect on your leadership journey, consider how you can leverage artifical intelligence to adapt to change and drive it. The leaders of tomorrow will be those who embrace AI as a catalyst for growth, guiding their organizations with vision, agility, and confidence.

The most common reason cited was a lack of suitable candidates. From the prospective employee’s perspective, ‘undesirable working conditions’ were listed as the greatest concern.\\nAustralian employment website SEEK says there is tightness in the labour market, but only just. The company reveals its list of the five trends that will shape work in the year ahead.\\n1. There industries that are growing\\nIf you are a part of the care economy, an IT professional, or a truck driver, you are going to see continued growth in 2025.\\n“The number of older Australians continues to grow, alongside an increasing awareness of mental health and behavioural conditions- driving an ongoing demand for care workers. This is unlikely to end anytime soon,” says Blair Chapman, SEEK’s senior economist.\\nRegistered nurses, aged and disabled carers and child carers will be in hot demand. 2025 will bring strong demand in Information & Communication Technology, Transport & Logistics, Retail & Hospitality.\\n“Employment for programmers and data scientists is likely to continue growing quickly as businesses look to keep up with the increasing use of AI by their employees, clients and competitors,” says Chapman.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nOnline shopping is also driving growth in the digital arena, is online shopping.\\n“The use of online delivery services will continue to drive demand for workers in the logistics sector, so it is likely that demand for truck drivers and warehouse staff like store persons and forklift drivers will remain elevated in 2025.”\\nKeep an eye on: “A stabilisation of job ad volumes in 2025. As a leading indicator, ad volumes should stabilise ahead of the RBA’s expected leveling off of the unemployment rate in mid to late 2025.”\\n2. Use AI to give your résumé a glow-up\\nUsing AI to write or refine your resume is becoming commonplace.\\n“SEEK data shows that the number of AI-generated resumes submitted to the platform grew from 10% in July 2023 to 25% in June 2024, and around half of all resumes are expected to be created with the support of AI in the coming months. But if used responsibly, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” says Grant Wright, a SEEK AI executive.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nWright cautions job seekers not to lean too heavily on AI, however.\\n“When used appropriately, AI can enhance resumes and job applications by refining ideas and helping candidates showcase their best selves. But it’s important that job seekers maintain control over their content and ensure it remains true to who they are. Relying too heavily on AI risks losing personal touch, making it harder to stand out and challenging for employers to trust the authenticity of the information provided,” says Wright.\\nKeep an eye on: “AI’s ability to understand unstructured text, image, video and voice content will enable new interaction modes and experiences that help candidates and hirers better express what they are looking for.”\\n3. Select better candidates\\nJust as artificial intelligence can help generate a strong resume, it can also aid when hirers have to sift through a large amount of resume submissions.\\n“In the current cost-conscious environment, with a relatively tight labour market and extremely high application volumes, the time and effort that goes into the recruitment process is an increasingly crucial problem to solve for most hirers,” says Simon Lusted, a SEEK product executive.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\n“From writing the job ad, to salary benchmarking, shortlisting candidates and following up. Our focus is on reducing friction, or hold-ups, when hiring, and in surfacing good candidates in real time, reducing the lag between deciding to hire and making an offer.”\\nKeep an eye on: “AI supporting both sides of the hiring process, but importantly, increasingly improving the outcomes for both hirers and candidates – with better matches made faster.”\\n4. Build culture\\nStriving to make work a somewhat enjoyable endeavour pays dividends in retention and productivity.\\n“Connection between teams, as well as within teams, is valuable for both the business and for its people,” says Kathleen McCudden, a SEEK people & culture\\xa0executive. “Activities such as social committees, informal learning and ideation sessions, and joint projects that encourage cross-functional collaboration are just some examples of initiatives to help drive deeper connections across teams.”\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\nBuilding culture can be difficult when teams are working remotely.\\n“Fostering connection among employees remains a challenge for many companies working with hybrid and geographically disparate teams. We’ve learnt that distributed teams can work effectively together, but it requires deliberate effort to build rapport and foster a sense of belonging amongst people,” says McCudden.\\nKeep an eye on: “Balancing the needs of an individual, the team, and the organisation in fostering a sustainable and flexible work environment, which enables a strong connection amongst people.”\\n5. Focus on purpose and community\\nIn a time when budgets are shrinking and economic uncertainty abounds, prioritising workplace engagement and community may seem like wasted time to some.\\nAimee Hutton, SEEK’s head of Customer Insights & Strategy, says SEEK research shows that salary and flexibility are motivators, however, the type of work and who employees are working with are the key drivers of happiness.\\nFive workplace trends to expect in 2025. Image: Getty\\n“As the workforce shifts, with fewer of the older generation (Baby Boomers) and\\nmore Gen Z employees, understanding the drivers of happiness is increasingly important. Having a purpose at work is the top driver of workplace happiness,” says Hutton.\\nWorkplace demographics are evolving and a sense of purpose is becoming more important than ever.\\n“While rising operating costs and reduced hiring budgets may continue to drive business decisions as we head into 2025, we also know that it is vital for businesses to understand and foster engagement among their employees for the betterment of both the business and their workers,” says Hutton.\\nKeep an eye on: “The shifting composition of the workforce and the rising needs of Gen Z.”\\nLook back on the week that was with hand-picked articles from Australia and around the world.\\xa0Sign up to the Forbes Australia newsletter here\\xa0or\\xa0become a member here.\\nMore from Forbes Australia\\nThe critical role of workplaces in addressing Australia’s national crisis of violence against women: A call to action\\nBy BRANDVOICE\\nBrand Voice Contributor\\nHere’s what Australians do and don’t love in the workplace\\nBy Shivaune Field\\nBusiness Journalist\\nWhy purpose is driving 60% of employees towards new workplaces\\nBy Elise Shaw\\nDigital Editor\\nBy Shivaune Field Business Journalist\\nTopics: BusinessEntrepreneursProductivityTechnologyWorkplace\\nAsides\\nSections\\nNews\\nEvents\\nLists\\nLife\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nContact us\\nCareers\\nAdvertise with us\\nMedia\\nExplore\\nBillionaires\\nEntrepreneurs\\nInnovation\\nLeadership\\nSocial\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nInstagram\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nMagazines covers\\nGet the magazine delivered with a Premium membership, find it at all good newsagents, or purchase previous issues online.\\n© 2024 Success Publishing Pty Ltd including content reproduced under license from Forbes IP (HK) LTD.

Log in.\\nMore universities are offering degrees in artificial intelligence, so BI rounded them up.\\nThe AI major offerings have launched as Big Tech invests heavily in LLMs and AI products.\\nOther institutes are offering graduate degrees in AI or degrees with AI specializations.\\nAdvertisement\\nUniversities are evolving their offerings in the age of artificial intelligence. Now, students have the option to pursue a full degree dedicated to AI.\\nAs more colleges introduce an AI major, it means the computer science degree, long viewed as a pipeline into Big Tech, has some more competition.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe new AI majors arrive as the industry goes through change, with many tech companies investing heavily in LLMs and generative AI products while simultaneously tightening their belts and trimming staff.\\nThe battle for top AI talent — researchers and engineers at the top of their game — is fierce, with CEOs personally trying to woo hires.\\nA degree in AI may prove tempting for current and future students hoping to get training and experience with LLMs and generative AI early in their careers. While computer science degrees can cover a wide array of fields, including computer programming, data science, computer systems analysis, and more, AI jobs can require more specific skills in machine learning and algorithms.\\nAdvertisement\\nUniversities are quickly looking to step in and fill that gap.\\nProfessor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon\\'s computer science master\\'s program, told BI that as the AI revolution continues to sweep industries, education is also adapting to keep up.\\n\"You\\'ll see AI sort of permeating pretty much any curriculum these days,\" he said. \"That\\'s here to stay.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nUndergraduate degrees\\nCarnegie Mellon is one institute that has already created a bachelor of science in artificial intelligence, a trend that is already picking up steam across other universities.\\nIn February, the University of Pennsylvania became the first Ivy League school to announce an undergraduate degree in AI. Beginning this academic year, students earning a BSE in Artificial Intelligence can explore courses in machine learning, computing algorithms, data analytics, and advanced robotics.\\n\"We are training students for jobs that don\\'t yet exist in fields that may be completely new or revolutionized by the time they graduate,\" said Robert Ghrist, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education in Penn Engineering, in a statement at the time.\\nAdvertisement\\nUniversities that have begun to offer Bachelor of Sciences in Artificial Intelligence include:\\nCarnegie Mellon University\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\\nDakota State University\\nIllinois Institute of Technology\\nKeiser University\\nLong Island University\\nNew England Institute of Technology\\nOakland University\\nUC Santa Barbara\\nUniversity of Texas San Antonio\\nSome institutes that don\\'t have dedicated AI degrees still offer concentrations in AI and/or machine learning.\\nAdvertisement\\n\"Something like mechanical engineering or civil engineering will typically have a version of the program with an emphasis on AI and a more traditional degree that students might take,\" Garlan said.\\nFor example, Boston University students earning a BS in biomedical, computer, electrical, or mechanical engineering can pursue a concentration in machine learning. Stanford University\\'s symbolic systems degree and Carnegie Mellon\\'s computer science degree also offer AI concentrations. Meanwhile, Duke University\\'s CS degree offers a concentration that covers both AI and machine learning.\\nRelated stories\\nGraduate Degrees\\nGraduate degrees in AI offer a great specialization to those who completed a CS major in undergrad or simply those looking to get into the field after earning their bachelor\\'s degree.\\nAdvertisement\\nSome institutes that don\\'t have undergraduate degrees still offer graduate degree programs in AI, both online and in-person.\\nSchools that offer an MS, MSE, or ME in specifically artificial intelligence include:\\nCarnegie Mellon\\nDuke\\nJohn Hopkins\\nJohn Hopkins University\\nUCLA\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\nAdvertisement\\nSome schools that offer master\\'s in computer science with AI or machine learning specializations include:\\nColumbia University\\nCornell University\\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\\nRice University\\nStanford University\\nUSC\\nFor students nearing college or selecting a major, there\\'s no one perfect track, and there are plenty of factors to consider.\\nAdvertisement\\nWith the addition of these undergraduate and graduate degrees, students who know they want a career in AI now have more pathways to choose from — with more likely on the way as universities seek to stay competitive.\\nRead next\\nAI\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nRecommended video\\nAdvertisement\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Santiago | Getty Images\\nGenerative artificial intelligence probably won\\'t change your life in 2025 — at least, not more than it already has, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT two years ago, generative AI quickly captured the imagination of users around the world. Now, with the industry\\'s competitive landscape somewhat established — multiple big tech companies, including Google, have competing models — it\\'ll take time for another technological breakthrough to shock the AI industry into hyper-speed development again, Pichai said at the New York Times\\' DealBook Summit last week.\\n\"I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone,\" said Pichai, adding: \"The hill is steeper ... You\\'re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage.\"\\nDON\\'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online\\nCurrent language models — like ChatGPT, Google\\'s Gemini or Meta\\'s Llama — will keep getting incrementally better, particularly \"at reasoning, completing a sequence of actions more reliably,\" Pichai said. Those improvements could help push AI closer to generating profits for corporate users — which isn\\'t happening yet, despite investments in the technology that are expected to surpass $1 trillion \"in coming years,\" according to\\xa0a recent Goldman Sachs report.\\nBut another seismic shift that changes the way most people think about or envision AI is unlikely to happen within the next year, said Pichai.\\nSome tech CEOs, like Microsoft\\'s Satya Nadella, agree with Pichai. \"Seventy years of the Industrial Revolution, there wasn\\'t much industry growth, and then it took off ... it\\'s never going to be linear,\" Nadella said at the Fast Company Innovation Festival 2024\\xa0in October.\\nOthers disagree, at least publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for example, posted \"there is no wall\" on social media platform X in November — a response to reports that the recently released ChatGPT-4 was only moderately better than previous models.\\nAI\\'s progress isn\\'t exactly walled off, Pichai said: Even incremental development will help hone the technology, making it increasingly more useful for a wider swath of people. Some industry jobs that don\\'t require college degrees can pay well: On average, AI trainers make more than $64,000 per year, and prompt engineers make more than $110,000, according to ZipRecruiter.\\n\"I think 10 years from now, [computer programming] will be accessible to millions more people,\" said Pichai.\\nWant to make extra money outside of your day job?

Visit the Help Centre.\\nFollowing their panel at Lawyers Weekly’s inaugural AI Innovate event, iManage legal product manager Jenny Hotchin and legal industry expert Madeleine Porter spoke with Lawyers Weekly about the tailored AI strategies and solutions they see increasingly implemented across the legal profession. They also explored the key drives behind this implementation and shared their insights on the future role of AI in the industry.\\nStrategic conversations about implementation\\nInitially, law firms took a cautious approach to AI, experimenting with isolated solutions or specific tools. However, Hotchin has observed a shift in this approach, with firms now engaging in more targeted discussions on how AI can be strategically deployed across their entire workforce.\\n“In law firms, there’s been a shift from playing and dipping the toe in the water with AI and looking at sort of discrete solutions to a more serious and strategic conversation,” Hotchin said.\\nVIEW ALL\\nSpecifically, Hotchin noted that one key area of focus in these discussions around AI implementation is the risk of accidental disclosure of confidential information, underscoring the need for robust solutions to mitigate this risk.\\n“One of the things that we’ve seen, especially with enterprise AI, is you apply these AI services across information, and then you’ve accidentally disclosed confidential information.\\n“So in the profession where we work with sensitive information [we] can’t be in that scenario. So we’re definitely seeing a focus on information security, respecting the security, making sure processing and everything else meets those security standards and then respecting the controls over bringing back to our world the controls over those documents,” Hotchin said.\\nHotchin highlighted that in this new era of AI, firms are no longer focusing solely on implementing standalone tools but are increasingly adopting a more comprehensive, long-term strategy that considers the bigger picture.\\n“The other thing that’s changed is understanding how the different pieces of the puzzle come together again. This kind of concept of looking at discrete things and then at the end-to-end workflow,” Hotchin said.\\n“We’re changing from a conversation [saying] this is how you can use generative AI and knowledge. This is how you can use generative AI in web products, and this is how you can use generative AI elsewhere. When you join the dots, then it gets exciting, and I think that’s how I’d summarise the real trend.”\\nThe driving forces behind AI implementation\\nGiven the inherent competitiveness within the legal profession, Porter noted that law firms are experiencing a strong sense of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) when it comes to AI implementation and adoption.\\nShe shared how many firms are eager to not only keep pace with their competitors but surpass them in terms of how and what AI solutions they incorporate into their practices.\\nHotchin said: “You’ve got these people who are competitive, interested and intelligent and want to do the very greatest and most exciting work. Of course, they’re going to want the latest tech to support them.”\\nPorter also explained that a key driver behind law firms’ adoption of AI is external pressure, particularly from clients. As clients become more informed about the potential of AI, she discussed how they are increasingly seeking tailored AI solutions as part of the legal services they receive.\\n“Clients are asking them, what are you doing with AI? Some clients are asking for very, very tailored AI solutions as part of their matter. So if they’re unable to deliver that and meet their client’s expectations [and] their client requests, they’ll just go to another law firm willing to,” Porter said.\\nThe demand for AI is not only driven by clients but also by internal factors within law firms, with Porter noting that competition to attract and retain top talent is a key factor in accelerating the adoption of AI within the legal profession.\\n“It’s a talent retention piece as well, and it’s an attractive tool. So if you’re a law firm and you want to attract the latest grads or the best grads, they’re going to be looking at your tech stack to say, what have you got?\\n“Oh, well, this firm uses this amazing AI tool. I know this has great capabilities. If I go with them, my life will actually be easier because I’ve seen the results in practice. So it’s going to be competitive from that angle as well,” Porter said.\\nThe road ahead\\nLooking ahead, it is clear that AI will continue to drive significant transformation in the legal profession, with Porter observing that such a profound change has not occurred before.\\n“It’s going to transform the legal profession, and the legal profession has not had this fundamental shake-up hundreds of years ago; we’ve practised law the same way,” Porter said.\\nShe explained that the implementation of such transformative technology within the legal profession would “revolutionise how we practise, how we structure our days, the workflows, how we bill”.\\nHowever, Porter emphasised that the core principles of practising law will remain unchanged and will continue as usual.\\n“Obviously, the fundamental aspects of practising law will not change, such as the duty of confidentiality, your fiduciary obligations, all those ethical and professional rules and considerations. That’s going to stay the same. But it’s a million-dollar question. The way we practise law will change,” Porter said.\\nReflecting on the future of AI in the legal profession, Hotchin noted that the coming year will be pivotal for law firms aiming to move beyond the hype and focus on harnessing the tangible value AI can offer.\\n“I hope it’s the year that we get rid of some of the hype and the bullshit. I hope it’s the year that we start to really think about how technology can help the end user,” Hotchin said.\\n“I am excited for next year in the sense that different pieces of the puzzle are coming together to really deliver some value, and it’s less about playing and more about having a more sort of serious strategic approach to this.”\\nTags\\nNews\\nlegal profession\\nAI\\niManage\\nShare\\nShare this article on:\\n×\\nFacebook\\nX\\nLinkedIn\\nCopy link\\nComments (0)\\nAdd New\\nAttach images by dragging & dropping or by selecting them.\\nThe maximum file size for uploads is MB.

They also explored the key drives behind this implementation and shared their insights on the future role of AI in the industry.\\nStrategic conversations about implementation\\nInitially, law firms took a cautious approach to AI, experimenting with isolated solutions or specific tools. However, Hotchin has observed a shift in this approach, with firms now engaging in more targeted discussions on how AI can be strategically deployed across their entire workforce.\\n“In law firms, there’s been a shift from playing and dipping the toe in the water with AI and looking at sort of discrete solutions to a more serious and strategic conversation,” Hotchin said.\\nVIEW ALL\\nSpecifically, Hotchin noted that one key area of focus in these discussions around AI implementation is the risk of accidental disclosure of confidential information, underscoring the need for robust solutions to mitigate this risk.\\n“One of the things that we’ve seen, especially with enterprise AI, is you apply these AI services across information, and then you’ve accidentally disclosed confidential information.\\n“So in the profession where we work with sensitive information [we] can’t be in that scenario. So we’re definitely seeing a focus on information security, respecting the security, making sure processing and everything else meets those security standards and then respecting the controls over bringing back to our world the controls over those documents,” Hotchin said.\\nHotchin highlighted that in this new era of AI, firms are no longer focusing solely on implementing standalone tools but are increasingly adopting a more comprehensive, long-term strategy that considers the bigger picture.\\n“The other thing that’s changed is understanding how the different pieces of the puzzle come together again. This kind of concept of looking at discrete things and then at the end-to-end workflow,” Hotchin said.\\n“We’re changing from a conversation [saying] this is how you can use generative AI and knowledge. This is how you can use generative AI in web products, and this is how you can use generative AI elsewhere. When you join the dots, then it gets exciting, and I think that’s how I’d summarise the real trend.”\\nThe driving forces behind AI implementation\\nGiven the inherent competitiveness within the legal profession, Porter noted that law firms are experiencing a strong sense of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) when it comes to AI implementation and adoption.\\nShe shared how many firms are eager to not only keep pace with their competitors but surpass them in terms of how and what AI solutions they incorporate into their practices.\\nHotchin said: “You’ve got these people who are competitive, interested and intelligent and want to do the very greatest and most exciting work. Of course, they’re going to want the latest tech to support them.”\\nPorter also explained that a key driver behind law firms’ adoption of AI is external pressure, particularly from clients. As clients become more informed about the potential of AI, she discussed how they are increasingly seeking tailored AI solutions as part of the legal services they receive.\\n“Clients are asking them, what are you doing with AI? Some clients are asking for very, very tailored AI solutions as part of their matter. So if they’re unable to deliver that and meet their client’s expectations [and] their client requests, they’ll just go to another law firm willing to,” Porter said.\\nThe demand for AI is not only driven by clients but also by internal factors within law firms, with Porter noting that competition to attract and retain top talent is a key factor in accelerating the adoption of AI within the legal profession.\\n“It’s a talent retention piece as well, and it’s an attractive tool. So if you’re a law firm and you want to attract the latest grads or the best grads, they’re going to be looking at your tech stack to say, what have you got?\\n“Oh, well, this firm uses this amazing AI tool. I know this has great capabilities. If I go with them, my life will actually be easier because I’ve seen the results in practice. So it’s going to be competitive from that angle as well,” Porter said.\\nThe road ahead\\nLooking ahead, it is clear that AI will continue to drive significant transformation in the legal profession, with Porter observing that such a profound change has not occurred before.\\n“It’s going to transform the legal profession, and the legal profession has not had this fundamental shake-up hundreds of years ago; we’ve practised law the same way,” Porter said.\\nShe explained that the implementation of such transformative technology within the legal profession would “revolutionise how we practise, how we structure our days, the workflows, how we bill”.\\nHowever, Porter emphasised that the core principles of practising law will remain unchanged and will continue as usual.\\n“Obviously, the fundamental aspects of practising law will not change, such as the duty of confidentiality, your fiduciary obligations, all those ethical and professional rules and considerations. That’s going to stay the same. But it’s a million-dollar question. The way we practise law will change,” Porter said.\\nReflecting on the future of AI in the legal profession, Hotchin noted that the coming year will be pivotal for law firms aiming to move beyond the hype and focus on harnessing the tangible value AI can offer.\\n“I hope it’s the year that we get rid of some of the hype and the bullshit. I hope it’s the year that we start to really think about how technology can help the end user,” Hotchin said.\\n“I am excited for next year in the sense that different pieces of the puzzle are coming together to really deliver some value, and it’s less about playing and more about having a more sort of serious strategic approach to this.”\\nTags\\nNews\\nlegal profession\\nAI\\niManage\\nShare\\nShare this article on:\\n×\\nFacebook\\nX\\nLinkedIn\\nCopy link\\nComments (0)\\nAdd New\\nAttach images by dragging & dropping or by selecting them.\\nThe maximum file size for uploads is MB.

Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, this lawsuit targets certain senior executives, both current and former, of Evolv. Investors have until the end of December 2024 to request to lead this case under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\\nDetails of Allegations\\nBetween the second quarters of 2022 and 2024, Evolv reportedly issued financial statements with critical inaccuracies concerning revenue recognition and other related metrics. On October 25, 2024, Evolv disclosed that their previous financial reports should not be trusted, as unforeseen contract terms had been undisclosed to accounting personnel. The issue involved sales to significant partners and misconduct within Evolv’s ranks. Subsequently, the company self-reported to the SEC, delaying their third-quarter report, leading to a dramatic 40% stock price drop, closing at $2.47 on October 25.\\nIn another profound move, on October 31, Evolv declared the abrupt termination of CEO Peter George. Michael Ellenbogen now steps in as interim CEO, pushing stock prices down by an additional 8%, closing at $2.15.\\nLegal Representation\\nBleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP, acclaimed for substantial wins, offers representation on a contingency basis, ensuring no upfront costs for shareholders involved.\\nTo participate or learn more, investors are encouraged to visit BFA’s dedicated webpage.\\nFor details on the case, head to: [BFA Case Information](https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/evolv-technologies-holdings-inc).\\nMajor Legal Shakeup as Evolv Technologies Faces Investor Lawsuit: What You Need to Know\\nThe legal landscape of security technology has taken a dramatic turn as Evolv Technologies Holdings, Inc. confronts a lawsuit spearheaded by law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP. This high-profile case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, targets key figures within Evolv for alleged revenue misreporting scandals. Below, we explore the wider implications and emerging trends surrounding this case.\\nInsights into the Allegations\\nBetween the second quarter of 2022 and 2024, Evolv’s financial practices came under scrutiny. The firm allegedly misreported financial statements, specifically misrepresenting revenue recognition. This discrepancy was compounded by the failure to disclose critical contract terms to accounting personnel, leading stakeholders to question the integrity of the company’s financial communications. The fallout from this acknowledgment included a significant 40% nosedive in stock value, with Evolv’s share price plunging to $2.47.\\nFallout and Management Shake-Up\\nThe company’s internal unrest further crystallized with the sudden termination of CEO Peter George on October 31, 2024. This drastic action stirred market instability, resulting in an additional 8% decline in stock prices. Michael Ellenbogen has stepped in as interim CEO, tasked with navigating through this turbulent period.\\nFinancial Impact and Stock Performance\\nThe repercussions on Evolv’s market position are notable. Stockholders have witnessed a dramatic devaluation of their holdings, prompting an urgent reassessment of Evolv’s financial health and corporate governance. The immediate reaction to leadership changes and financial restatements reflects a cautious market sentiment.\\nLegal Representation and Investor Actions\\nBleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP stands at the forefront of this class action, offering representation on a contingency basis. By eliminating upfront costs, they empower affected shareholders to engage in this pivotal litigation without financial hindrance. Investors have until the end of December 2024 to join the lawsuit under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\\nUse Cases and Future Predictions\\nThis lawsuit against Evolv underscores an increasing need for transparency and rigorous financial accountability in tech firms leveraging AI solutions. As these companies continue to innovate the security sector, stringent regulatory compliance and ethical governance may become quintessential to sustaining investor trust and market success.\\nEmerging Trends and Market Analysis\\nThe unfolding situation at Evolv could signal a broader trend of increased vigilance and regulatory scrutiny in AI-driven industries. As stakeholders demand greater clarity, companies may prioritize transparency and ensure comprehensive disclosure practices to safeguard their financial reputation.\\nFor a deeper understanding of legal actions and trends shaping technology firms, visit Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP.

Chatbots powered by AI are now at everyone's fingertips. We have seen increasing application of AI in many disciplines. Health care is also going through evolution due to the gradual incorporation of AI. It definitely offers a lot of exciting opportunities, especially for faster and more accurate diagnosis as well as precision medicine.\\nLooking back, work on AI has continued for a long time, and health care has always been a part of it. Back in the decade of the 50s and 60s', it was all about creating databases, e.g. electronic medical records and clinical information data. Such works eventually led to the launch of search engines like PubMed. Similar biomedical search engines saw a lot of growth at that time, and Ivy League universities started to use those more and more. This created a platform for enhanced collaboration among researchers.\\nThe use of AI in modern healthcare is not that uncommon. Online scheduling of appointments is an example. Evidence-based medicine, where a physician uses complete history and examination results for diagnosis and treatment is seen as the next logical step. AI can do all these faster and probably with greater accuracy than humans due to their computing powers. A study was published in the Nature journal in 2022 which looked at mammograms using AI technology. The result revealed that there was a reduction in false negatives by 9.4 per cent and false positives by 5.7 per cent. This is very promising.\\nDisease diagnosis will probably benefit immensely from AI. There are various uses of AI in the diagnosis of cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Two things stand out in this regard. First, machine learning is already assisting in workflow management and decision-making, making the entire process efficient. Second, deep learning, another aspect of AI, can leverage various data mining techniques to identify embedded patterns. Both ML and DL will be critical for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. One field where changes are already prominent is Radiology. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) is now quite common. IBM has developed a software called Avicenna, and it can scan diagnostic images and recognise abnormalities pretty well. Avicenna can also pull data from the available medical records, compare results and propose treatment options.\\nDiagnostic systems based on DL are already on the market. FDA approved Arterys, a medical imaging AI platform, in 2017, which can identify lesions, prepare reports, and present a list of potential diseases affecting the patient. There are AI systems being employed for colonoscopy and endoscopy to find out malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Data shows that DL-based technology evaluating chest X-rays can more accurately diagnose pneumonia than a human. An article in the Annals of Oncology journal (2018) presented a small dataset where AI diagnosed skin cancer more accurately than dermatologists.\\nThe speed, efficiency and specificity of lab procedures can be tremendously improved by AI. This can significantly improve detection and quantification of microorganisms, disease classification and clinical outcome analysis. Things like blood culture and sensitivity testing have been impacted very positively with rapid results, allowing the selection of proper antibiotics. Timely administration of the right antibiotic is critical to achieve the eradication of microorganisms and reduce the risk of resistance.\\nAI can be very useful in increasing the efficiency of patient flow, thereby prioritising more important patients and reducing wait time overall. This is possible with AI-driven tools designed to interact with the patients, collect data and formulate a management plan. Such real-time inputs can significantly speed up decision-making of healthcare professionals.\\nPrecision medicine should also benefit from AI. The whole concept of this approach is based on offering individualised treatment to each patient, according to their lifestyle, environment and genetic characteristics. As the speciality of AI is data mining and analysis at an extreme speed, you can imagine how efficiently we would be able to make the process. A group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology conducted a study using patients' genetic data to train ML. The system was then able to predict the response to anti-cancer drugs with a high level of success.\\nDixie B. Baker, a senior researcher in health information technology opined that with AI there will be a quicker turnout of large genetic, clinical, lifestyle and social datasets across a diverse population. Physicians will then just take a look at the screen and know what to prescribe. IBM's AI computer system Watson is a case in point. The Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina fed Watson genomic data for more than 1000 patients. The objective was to test its ability to recommend treatment for them. Their verdict was Watson could find optimal treatments faster than a human.\\nPerhaps the most widespread but overlooked use of AI in healthcare is patient education. We already have AI-based chatbots providing diet charts, lifestyle advice and behavioural therapies. Some AI-powered apps can even help with lifestyle modification, e.g. smoking cessation. This is very important because patient adherence to treatment is largely dependent on how well they understand their disease and what is required of them.\\nThough AI will inevitably become a cornerstone of healthcare, there are challenges we must be ready for. AI-based systems rely on available data, and if the quality of the data is lacking then the outcome will be similarly poor. There are also questions about data privacy and security. To ensure security, robust cybersecurity measures are required. Continuous engagement between experts and the public is also crucial for safety. Incorporating AI into the existing healthcare system also means a huge financial investment, that not everyone is prepared for.\\nAI will transform healthcare. The process is already on the way, and we can only hope for a better future. Productivity and efficiency of the service delivery will be increased, and a better patient experience is expected. But that does not mean healthcare providers will be out of the picture. They will always be an integral part of the overall care to ensure patients are getting what they require.\\nimtiazdmc@gmail.com\\nShare this news\\nMore News\\nJob Opportunities\\nEditor: Shamsul Huq Zahid\\nPublished by Syed Manzur Elahi for International Publications Limited from Tropicana Tower (4th floor), 45, Topkhana Road, GPO Box : 2526 Dhaka- 1000 and printed by him from The Transcraft Limited, 229, Tejgaon Industrial Area, Dhaka-1208\\nPABX : 02223389780 (Hunting)\\nMobile: 01917231083\\nFax : 880-2-02223387049\\nEmail: editor@thefinancialexpress.com.bdfexpress68@gmail.comfeonline99@gmail.com\\nQuick links\\nHome\\nEconomy\\nStock\\nTrade\\nNational\\nWorld\\nViews\\n--------\\nEducation\\nSci-Tech\\nHealth\\nSports\\nLifestyle\\nEnvironment\\n--------\\nAll News\\nToday's FE\\nE-paper\\nOnline Rates\\nAd Tariff\\nSitemap\\nSubscribe to Newsletter\\nSubscribe\\nYou'll get monthly newsletter from us!\\n© 2024 - All Rights with The Financial Express\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nTerms of Service\"}, {'title': 'AI is being used for some legal work: Clarke - FBC News', 'image_url': 'https://image.fnnews.com/resource/media/image/2022/09/10/202209100834444886_l.jpg', 'raw_content': \"HOME\\nNEWS\\nSPORTS\\nBUSINESS\\nSPECIAL EVENTS\\nWORLD\\nRADIO\\nTV\\nTRENDING\\nSUPER RUGBY PACIFIC\\nDEC 09 02:29 AM\\nWEATHER\\nSEARCH\\nNews\\nAI is being used for some legal work: Clarke\\nFilipe Naikaso\\nSenior Multimedia Journalist West\\nfnaikaso@fbc.com.fj\\nDECEMBER 7, 2024 4:38 PM\\nFiji law society President Wylie Clarke while presenting at the 26th Attorney General’s Conference\\nFiji law society President Wylie Clarke emphasizes the inevitability of AI deeply entrenching itself in legal practice.\\nWhile presenting at the 26th Attorney General’s Conference, Clarke notes that firms around the world, including those in the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, are already adopting AI tools in various forms.\\nHowever, Clarke warns that while AI has the potential to revolutionize the legal field, it is crucial that AI tools are tailored specifically for legal work.\\nReflecting on the challenges AI presents, Clarke also drew parallels with other industries, such as education, where AI is disrupting traditional methods.\\nClarke referenced a medical school in the US that has even integrated AI into its syllabus, assessing students based on their ability to ask the right questions of AI and interpreting its responses as a model he believes could be applied in legal training.\\nDespite the many benefits AI offers, Clarke cautions against over-reliance, highlighting a case in the US where lawyers, relying too heavily on AI, presented fabricated legal precedents that led to severe sanctions.\\n“AI is actually testing our lawyers and my legal knowledge. Because the key to getting the right outcome from AI is you’ve got to ask it the right question. And that requires, you know, really sound legal knowledge and understanding of the issues. Because it’s no point asking the AI the wrong question because you’re going to get the wrong answer.”\\nIn his own firm, Clarke shares positive experiences with AI, particularly its ability to quickly summarize complex contracts and aid in legal research.\\nNevertheless, Clarke acknowledged that there are still significant challenges to overcome, particularly in jurisdictions like Fiji, where laws and regulations around AI use remain underdeveloped.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nGovernment has a huge responsibility in protecting human rights\\nKey issues behind non-renewal of leases highlighted\\nSyrian

From quantum breakthroughs to multi-cloud complexities, the landscape has been redefined.\\nLet’s dive into the trends fundamentally changing business operations in the cloud era.\\nIf 2023 was the year AI went mainstream, 2024 is when it became the backbone of cloud computing. We’re seeing entire enterprises reimagined through AI-powered services.\\nThis transformation is particularly fascinating because it’s democratizing advanced AI capabilities and large language models for GenAI. Small start-ups can now access the same powerful AI tools that were once the exclusive domain of tech giants. This shift has led to AI-first architectures that optimize usage automatically, cloud services that predict and prevent operational issues, and hybrid systems blending human expertise with AI insights.\\nThe game-changer? These AI capabilities are now cost-effective, reaching organizations of all sizes.\\nArtificial intelligence (credit: INGIMAGE)\\nThe silent revolution in running code\\nThe days of meticulously managing servers are becoming as outdated as dial-up Internet. In 2024, serverless computing has evolved into an essential strategy, transforming how businesses approach infrastructure.\\nMedia streaming companies, for instance, handle millions of users with zero manual infrastructure management, scaling automatically during peaks and vanishing during downtimes. Key advances include pay-per-millisecond pricing models; reducing costs by up to 70%; instantaneous traffic scaling by cloud vendors; and zero-maintenance DBaaS (Database as a Service) with rapid scaling based on demand.\\nCybersecurity: The new arms race\\nCloud-based cyberattacks surged 48% in early 2024, but cloud security has also advanced. How? By evolving from reactive to predictive, with intelligent systems that learn and adapt. Transformative developments include AI-powered detection of anomalies in real-time; Mainstream adoption of quantum-resistant encryption, and Zero-trust architectures that treat all requests as potentially hostile.\\nFrom compromise to strategic advantage\\nStay updated with the latest news!\\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\\nSubscribe Now\\nThe hybrid cloud story of 2024 is about strategic advantage, not compromise. Organizations are finding that hybrid models aren’t just stepping stones but often optimal end states. Microservices adoption has revolutionized software consumption, shifting from rigid contracts to pure usage-based models. Successful transformations this year have come from companies embracing hybrid flexibility, combining pay-per-use benefits with robust infrastructure. What was once a one-way journey to the cloud is now a dynamic, value-driven operation.\\nManaging multiple clouds was once chaotic, but 2024 has introduced tools that make this complexity manageable. Think of having a universal remote that controls and optimizes your entire cloud ecosystem.\\nThe cloud’s next frontier\\nQuantum computing in the cloud might sound like science fiction, but in 2024, it’s becoming a science fact. While we haven’t achieved quantum supremacy, cloud providers are making quantum capabilities accessible in ways that were unimaginable just a year ago.\\nWhat makes this particularly exciting is how cloud platforms democratize access to quantum computing, allowing organizations to experiment with quantum algorithms without investing in quantum hardware.\\nThe cloud in 2025 and beyond\\nThe cloud is no longer just infrastructure but a driver of business innovation. Successful companies in 2024 are those transformed by cloud technologies. Looking forward, we’re seeing early signs of:\\n• On-demand LLM, both commercial and open-source\\n• AI-driven visual tools for cloud infrastructure management\\n• Cloud-native AI-based security services\\n• The integration of edge computing with traditional cloud\\n• Quantum-classical hybrid systems becoming viable\\nEmbracing the new cloud reality\\nIn conclusion, 2024 has taught us that the cloud is no longer about “if” or “when” – it’s about “how well.” Organizations that understand this and adapt accordingly aren’t just surviving; they’re thriving in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\\nThe key to success in this new landscape isn’t just adopting the latest technologies – it’s about understanding how these technologies can transform your business. As we move forward, the question isn’t whether to embrace these changes, but how to leverage them for maximum impact.\\nThe cloud of 2024 is more than a technology platform, it’s a business transformation engine. For those ready to embrace it, the possibilities are endless. Remember, tomorrow’s game-changers in cloud computing are already here – they’re just not evenly distributed yet.\\nThe writer is chief technology officer at CloudZone.\\nRelated Tags\\ntechnology\\nArtificial intelligence\\nAI\\nFuture\\nHot Opinion\\n### Syria’s collapse: An opportunity and a risk for Israel\\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\\n### For every bright moment there is a dark lining\\nBy URI PILICHOWSKI\\n### Hypocrisy and deception: The gender segregation bill\\nBy URI REGEV\\n### Grapevine December 8, 2024: A suitable match\\nBy GREER FAY CASHMAN\\n### Israel feels like it\\'s falling apart - to move forward, accountability must be taken\\nBy YAAKOV KATZ\\nMost Read\\n1 ### The toppling of Assad\\'s regime in Syria may be bad news for Israel\\n2 ### An IDF reservist\\'s top ten takeaways after returning from Gaza\\n3 ### Russia warns the United States of the risks of World War Three\\n4 ### My decision was made, I will watch the Iranian missile attack\\n5 ### \\'Antisemitic nightmare at Fontainebleau Miami beach,\\' says Rabbi Shmuley\\nAdvertisement\\nInformation\\nAbout Us\\nContact us\\nFeedback\\nTerms Of Service\\nPrivacy Policy\\nSubscriber Agreement\\nJPost Jobs\\nCancel Subscription\\nSitemap\\nCustomer Service\\nJP Store\\nAdvertise with Us\\nפרסום בג\\'רוזלם פוסט\\nThe Jerusalem Post Group\\nBreaking News\\nWorld News\\nIran News\\nMDA Heroes\\nThe Jerusalem Report\\nJerusalem Post Lite\\nReal Estate Listings\\nServices\\nPrecious Metals\\nTools and services\\nJPost Premium\\nUlpan Online\\nJPost Newsletter\\nOur Magazines\\nLearn Hebrew\\nRSS feed\\nJPost.com Archive\\nDigital Library\\nLists of Jewish holidays\\nלוח חגים ומועדים 2024\\nזמני כניסת שבת\\nחדשות מעריב\\nSites Of Interest\\nPoalim Online\\nJNF-USA\\nThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be contacted with any questions or requests:\\nTelephone: *2421 * Extension 4 Jerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com\\nThe center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM and 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM and 12:30 PM\\nFor international customers: The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll Free number 1-800-448-9291 Telephone +972-3-761-9056 Fax: 972-3-561-3699 E-mail: subs@jpost.com\\nCopyright © 2024 Jpost Inc.

NFL odds and revealed its NFL predictions, NFL score predictions, and NFL betting picks for every game\\nBy CBS Sports Staff\\nDec 8, 2024 at 11:09 am ET • 3 min read\\nUSATSI\\nThe NFL playoffs are approaching quickly and the Week 14 NFL schedule features several games with major postseason implications. The Kansas City Chiefs (11-1) will have a chance to clinch the AFC West in a head-to-head matchup with the Los Angeles Chargers (8-4) on Sunday Night Football. Meanwhile, the Bills (10-2) hold a tiebreaker over the Chiefs for home-field advantage in the AFC if they can catch them and Buffalo has a critical matchup on the road against the Rams (6-6) on Sunday. Giants receiver Malik Nabers (hip), Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee), Chargers receiver Ladd McConkey (shoulder/knee), Bears running back D'Andre Swift (quad), Steelers receiver George Pickens (hamstring),\\xa0and Bears receiver D.J. Moore are among those players who are questionable this week. Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker (calf/ankle) and Jets running back Breece Hall (knee) are among those who have been ruled out.\\nThe latest Week 14 NFL odds list the Chiefs as four-point home favorites on Sunday Night Football with an over-under of 43, while the Bills are 3.5-point road favorites in the Week 14 NFL spreads with an over-under of 49.5. Before you make any Week 14 NFL picks and Week 14 NFL score predictions, you need to\\xa0see the NFL against the spread, NFL over-under, and NFL money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.\\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game. The AI predictions are determined by statistically learning from each team's historical data and then quantitatively evaluating the strength of the opponent's defense by assigning a numeric value out of 100 called a matchup score.\\nOnce a prediction is formulated, the AI rating is generated using the prediction, the matchup score, and the odds of the market. For example, you could see an A-rating on an over bet if a team is facing a poor defense, their prediction differs from the line and there are favorable odds.\\nIn addition, SportsLine AI is the first fully automated predictive model at SportsLine. It continuously refreshes on the most recent available data and can help you spot the biggest discrepancies in the lines. SportsLine's AI PickBot has hit a whopping 2,073 4.5- and 5-star prop picks since the start of last season. Anyone who has followed it is way up at their best sports betting app\\xa0and favorite betting sites.\\nFor Week 14\\xa0NFL betting, the AI PickBot has evaluated the NFL odds and provided NFL\\xa0betting picks for all 13 games.\\xa0You can only see the AI predictions for the Week 14 NFL schedule here.\\nTop Week 14 NFL AI picks\\nAfter analyzing every game in Week 14, the AI PickBot says the Cowboys cover comfortably as 5.5-point home underdogs against the Bengals on Monday Night Football in a game with an over-under of 49.5. Cincinnati's offense is one of the most potent in the NFL, but defense continues to let the Bengals down. They've lost games this season where they've scored 27, 33, 34 and 38 (twice).\\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys have seemingly found their rhythm the last couple weeks with division wins over the Commanders and Giants. The Dallas defense has forced five turnovers in those two victories and Micah Parsons has been a man possessed since returning from injury, recording 1.5 sacks or more in three of four games.\\nThe Cowboys have scored 61 combined points over the last two weeks and have made strides after Cooper Rush struggled in his first two starts. AI PickBot rates a Cowboys cover as an A+ pick and also predicts a 36-32 outright win on average.\\xa0See its other Week 14 football predictions and football picks at SportsLine.\\nHow to make Week 14 NFL picks\\nIn addition, the AI PickBot has generated four highly-coveted A+ picks for Week 14. You need to see the AI PickBot's NFL picks before making any Week 14 NFL bets of your own.\\xa0You can only see them at SportsLine.\\nWho wins and covers each Week 14 NFL game, and which A+ picks should you target now? Visit SportsLine now to see the top NFL picks against the spread, over-under, and on money line, all from the self-learning SportsLine AI PickBot that has nailed 2,073 top-rated picks since the start of last season.\\nOur Latest NFL Stories\\nWeek 14 NFL picks, parlays, DFS advice and more\\nCBS Sports Staff • 6 min read\\nSteelers' Pickens (hamstring) inactive vs. Browns\\nBryan DeArdo • 1 min read\\nNFL model simulates every Week 14 game 10,000 times\\nCBS Sports Staff • 5 min read\\nDolphins vs. Jets picks, how to watch, stream\\nCBS Sports Staff • 3 min read\\n'Reborn' Wilson says Steelers can win the Super Bowl\\nBryan DeArdo • 1 min read\\nReport: Jets likely to draft QB even if Rodgers remains\\nShanna McCarriston • 2 min read\\nShare\\nShare Video\\nLink copied!\\nSelf-learning AI reveals Week 14 NFL picks\\nCBS Sports Staff 3 min read\\nNFL Week 14 expert picks, best bets\\nJordan Dajani 11 min read\\nMVP Watch: Barkley catching up to Allen\\nCody Benjamin 2 min read\\nBold predictions: L.A. teams pull shockers\\nGarrett Podell 5 min read\\nPrisco's picks: Chiefs lock up AFC West\\nPete Prisco 5 min read\\nSteelers' Pickens inactive vs. Browns with hamstring\\nBryan DeArdo 1 min read\\nNFL back to Germany in 2025 with first-ever Berlin game\\nJonathan Jones 1 min read\\n'Reborn' Wilson says Steelers can win Super Bowl\\nBryan DeArdo 1 min read\\nReport: Jets likely to draft QB even if Rodgers remains\\nShanna McCarriston 2 min read\\nNFL considered suspending Al-Shaair for rest of season\\nJonathan Jones 3 min read\\nMore\\nPick'em Games\\nFantasy Sports\\nFree Sports TV\\nBetting Analysis\\nMarch Madness\\nMobile Apps\\nCompany\\nAbout Us\\nCareers\\nAbout Paramount\\nParamount+\\nRegulation\\nTerms Of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nClosed Captioning\\nCalifornia Notice\\nCookie Policy\\nContact Us\\nHelp\\nCustomer Care\\nSocial Media\\nYouTube\\nTikTok\\nInstagram\\nFacebook\\nX\\nThreads\\nFlipboard\\nAccount\\nManage My Account\\nNewsletters\\nMy Teams\\nWallet\\nForgot Password\\n© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Visit the Help Centre.\\nFollowing their panel at Lawyers Weekly’s inaugural AI Innovate event, iManage legal product manager Jenny Hotchin and legal industry expert Madeleine Porter spoke with Lawyers Weekly about the tailored AI strategies and solutions they see increasingly implemented across the legal profession. They also explored the key drives behind this implementation and shared their insights on the future role of AI in the industry.\\nStrategic conversations about implementation\\nInitially, law firms took a cautious approach to AI, experimenting with isolated solutions or specific tools. However, Hotchin has observed a shift in this approach, with firms now engaging in more targeted discussions on how AI can be strategically deployed across their entire workforce.\\n“In law firms, there’s been a shift from playing and dipping the toe in the water with AI and looking at sort of discrete solutions to a more serious and strategic conversation,” Hotchin said.\\nVIEW ALL\\nSpecifically, Hotchin noted that one key area of focus in these discussions around AI implementation is the risk of accidental disclosure of confidential information, underscoring the need for robust solutions to mitigate this risk.\\n“One of the things that we’ve seen, especially with enterprise AI, is you apply these AI services across information, and then you’ve accidentally disclosed confidential information.\\n“So in the profession where we work with sensitive information [we] can’t be in that scenario. So we’re definitely seeing a focus on information security, respecting the security, making sure processing and everything else meets those security standards and then respecting the controls over bringing back to our world the controls over those documents,” Hotchin said.\\nHotchin highlighted that in this new era of AI, firms are no longer focusing solely on implementing standalone tools but are increasingly adopting a more comprehensive, long-term strategy that considers the bigger picture.\\n“The other thing that’s changed is understanding how the different pieces of the puzzle come together again. This kind of concept of looking at discrete things and then at the end-to-end workflow,” Hotchin said.\\n“We’re changing from a conversation [saying] this is how you can use generative AI and knowledge. This is how you can use generative AI in web products, and this is how you can use generative AI elsewhere. When you join the dots, then it gets exciting, and I think that’s how I’d summarise the real trend.”\\nThe driving forces behind AI implementation\\nGiven the inherent competitiveness within the legal profession, Porter noted that law firms are experiencing a strong sense of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) when it comes to AI implementation and adoption.\\nShe shared how many firms are eager to not only keep pace with their competitors but surpass them in terms of how and what AI solutions they incorporate into their practices.\\nHotchin said: “You’ve got these people who are competitive, interested and intelligent and want to do the very greatest and most exciting work. Of course, they’re going to want the latest tech to support them.”\\nPorter also explained that a key driver behind law firms’ adoption of AI is external pressure, particularly from clients. As clients become more informed about the potential of AI, she discussed how they are increasingly seeking tailored AI solutions as part of the legal services they receive.\\n“Clients are asking them, what are you doing with AI? Some clients are asking for very, very tailored AI solutions as part of their matter. So if they’re unable to deliver that and meet their client’s expectations [and] their client requests, they’ll just go to another law firm willing to,” Porter said.\\nThe demand for AI is not only driven by clients but also by internal factors within law firms, with Porter noting that competition to attract and retain top talent is a key factor in accelerating the adoption of AI within the legal profession.\\n“It’s a talent retention piece as well, and it’s an attractive tool. So if you’re a law firm and you want to attract the latest grads or the best grads, they’re going to be looking at your tech stack to say, what have you got?\\n“Oh, well, this firm uses this amazing AI tool. I know this has great capabilities. If I go with them, my life will actually be easier because I’ve seen the results in practice. So it’s going to be competitive from that angle as well,” Porter said.\\nThe road ahead\\nLooking ahead, it is clear that AI will continue to drive significant transformation in the legal profession, with Porter observing that such a profound change has not occurred before.\\n“It’s going to transform the legal profession, and the legal profession has not had this fundamental shake-up hundreds of years ago; we’ve practised law the same way,” Porter said.\\nShe explained that the implementation of such transformative technology within the legal profession would “revolutionise how we practise, how we structure our days, the workflows, how we bill”.\\nHowever, Porter emphasised that the core principles of practising law will remain unchanged and will continue as usual.\\n“Obviously, the fundamental aspects of practising law will not change, such as the duty of confidentiality, your fiduciary obligations, all those ethical and professional rules and considerations. That’s going to stay the same. But it’s a million-dollar question. The way we practise law will change,” Porter said.\\nReflecting on the future of AI in the legal profession, Hotchin noted that the coming year will be pivotal for law firms aiming to move beyond the hype and focus on harnessing the tangible value AI can offer.\\n“I hope it’s the year that we get rid of some of the hype and the bullshit. I hope it’s the year that we start to really think about how technology can help the end user,” Hotchin said.\\n“I am excited for next year in the sense that different pieces of the puzzle are coming together to really deliver some value, and it’s less about playing and more about having a more sort of serious strategic approach to this.”\\nTags\\nNews\\nlegal profession\\nAI\\niManage\\nShare\\nShare this article on:\\n×\\nFacebook\\nX\\nLinkedIn\\nCopy link\\nComments (0)\\nAdd New\\nAttach images by dragging & dropping or by selecting them.\\nThe maximum file size for uploads is MB.

December 202403 Mins Read\\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 13: CEO of Zenefits David Sacks speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 at Pier 48 on September 13, 2016 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch)\\nDavid Sacks’ new role focuses on AI and crypto policy innovation under President-elect Trump’s administration.\\nSacks brings vast tech expertise from PayPal, Yammer, and venture capital to shape U.S. AI and crypto regulations.\\nDavid Sacks, a name synonymous with innovation and leadership in the IT industry, was recently appointed by President-elect Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. This new role represents a significant milestone in Sacks’ extensive career, as it integrates his extensive technological knowledge with the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and crypto.\\nDavid Sacks: From Cape Town to Silicon Valley\\nDavid Oliver Sacks was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on May 25, 1972. He left early on for the United States. After more study at Stanford University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1994.\\nHe continued his academic path at the University of Chicago Law School, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 1998. These early years set a strong basis for his later activities in the tech sector.\\nWhen Sacks joined Confinity, a startup that would ultimately become PayPal, his professional path veered significantly in the late 1990s. He was crucial in creating PayPal’s product and business plans as the Chief Operating Officer, which helped explain its explosive expansion and final acquisition by eBay in 2002.\\nThis encounter sharpened his leadership abilities and positioned him as a major participant in the developing online payment industry.\\nAfter his success at PayPal, Sacks entered the business world, creating Yammer, an enterprise social networking tool and Geni.com, a genealogy website.\\nYammer’s creative approach to office communication attracted a lot of interest, which helped Microsoft buy it for $1.2 billion in 2012. These projects highlighted Sacks’s capacity for spotting and nurturing original technology ideas.\\nChampioning Innovation and the Rise of Cryptocurrency\\nIn 2017, Sacks co-founded Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm that targets technology entrepreneurs. Through Craft Ventures, he has helped a wide range of businesses—including those in the crypto industry. His portfolio of investments shows a strong passion for new technology and a dedication to supporting creativity in several spheres.\\nRecognizing their ability to transform digital payments, Sacks has been an outspoken promoter of cryptocurrency. Having made investments in several blockchain initiatives, he has especially helped Solana, a high-performance blockchain system.\\nSacks highlighted his forward-looking view of the future of digital currencies in a 2021 edition of the “All-In” podcast, which he co-hosts, on Solana’s possible ability to outperform Ethereum as a top smart contract platform.\\nDavid Sacks: Steering U.S. Leadership in AI and Crypto\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump declared on December 6, 2024, David Sacks’s appointment as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. This recently appointed role gives Sacks direction on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, therefore directing U.S. policy.\\nReflecting the government’s goal to establish the United States as a leader in these fast-changing sectors, his portfolio includes creating a clear legal framework for the crypto firm and defending online free speech.\\nThe IT industry has greeted Sacks’ nomination with excitement, many seeing it as a positive step toward encouraging invention and setting clearer rules in the AI and cryptocurrency areas. His broad knowledge in technology and venture finance helps him to negotiate the challenging junction of policy and technical development.\\nAs he assumes this powerful position, Sacks positions himself to use his experience to guide policies that strike a balance between innovation and regulatory control.\\nHis path from a digital entrepreneur to a major political appointment highlights a career defined by flexibility and a forward-looking attitude to the possibilities and problems posed by new technologies.\\nDavid Sacks story\\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down.\\nPhoto Credit: Bloomberg\\nAt this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024.\\nTo keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today.\\nInterestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions.\\nAnd keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month!\\nPrediction 1: Nvidia will dramatically ramp up its efforts to become a cloud provider.\\nOutcome: Right\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### FBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Change WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal Apps\\n### What To Know About The UnitedHealthcare CEO Murder—As NYPD Releases New Photos Of Suspect\\n### iOS 18.2 Release Date: iPhone’s New Upgrade Is Hours Away\\nNvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow.\\nFor now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course.\\nNvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia.\\nIt will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead.\\nPrediction 2: Stability AI will shut down.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nThings went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April.\\nIt seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true.\\nBut the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors.\\nThe Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern.\\nPrediction 3: The terms “large language model” and “LLM” will become less common.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nAt least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here.\\nIn a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote:\\n“It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.”\\nWe agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models.\\nBut the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology.\\nPrediction 4: The most advanced closed models will continue to outperform the most advanced open models by a meaningful margin.\\nOutcome: Right\\nThe release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing.\\nThen OpenAI dropped o1.\\no1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research.\\nIn his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.”\\nBefore o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference.\\nBecause it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead.\\nIt is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance.\\nThis is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year:\\n“As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.”\\nPrediction 5: A number of Fortune 500 companies will create a new C-suite position: Chief AI Officer.\\nOutcome: Right\\nIn 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts.\\nConsidering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025.\\nPrediction 6: An alternative to the transformer architecture will see meaningful adoption.\\nOutcome: Right\\nThe transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.”\\nThat alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM).\\nMamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture.\\nCartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs.\\n(Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.)\\nPrediction 7: Strategic investments from cloud providers into AI startups—and the associated accounting implications—will be challenged by regulators.\\nOutcome: Right\\nHyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year.\\nThe FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic.\\nRegulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared.\\nThese regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.”\\nPrediction 8: The Microsoft/OpenAI relationship will begin to fray.\\nOutcome: Right\\nA steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”)\\nOpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer.\\nOther sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief.\\nPrediction 9: Some of the hype and herd mentality behavior that shifted from crypto to AI in 2023 will shift back to crypto in 2024.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nWe wrote in last December’s predictions article:\\n“Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.”\\nThis has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started.\\nSo why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening.\\nPrediction 10: At least one U.S. court will rule that generative AI models trained on the internet represent a violation of copyright. The issue will begin working its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\nOutcome: Wrong\\nNearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation.\\nBut a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases.\\nIn other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move.\\nBut substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.\\nSee here for the original article with our 2024 AI predictions.\\nSee here for our 2023 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nSee here for our 2022 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nSee here for our 2021 AI predictions, and see here for our retrospective on them.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter.\\nRob Toews\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

AI 기술을 통한 생존과 성장\\nAI는 이제 단순한 도구를 넘어 기업 운영과 성장에 필수적인 파트너로 자리잡고 있습니다. McKinsey의 보고서에 따르면, 현재 65%의 조직이 적어도 하나의 비즈니스 기능에서 생성적 AI를 정기적으로 활용하고 있으며, 이는 의사결정의 정밀성과 운영 효율성을 높이는 데 기여하고 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 AI가 데이터를 실시간으로 분석하여 더 나은 결정을 가능하게 한다는 점에서 주목할 만합니다.\\n\\n### 2. 인재 관리와 AI의 상호작용\\n디지털 인력 구성에서 AI의 역할은 점점 더 중요해지고 있습니다. SEEK의 데이터에 따르면, AI 지원 이력서 작성의 성공률이 25% 증가했으며, 이는 인재 선별 과정에서 AI 활용이 증가하고 있음을 보여줍니다. AI는 후보자를 신속하고 효율적으로 추천하는 과정에서 기업 경영자에게 필수적인 도구로 자리잡고 있습니다.\\n\\n### 3. 지속적인 학습 문화의 필요성\\n에이전틱 AI의 발전에 따라 리더들은 지속적인 학습의 중요성을 인식해야 합니다. 과거의 고정된 전문 지식으로는 더 이상 경쟁력을 유지할 수 없으며, AI에 대한 적응력과 데이터 활용 능력을 배양하는 것이 필수적입니다. 이를 통해 직원들은 AI를 보조 도구로 인식하고, 창의적 업무에 더욱 집중할 수 있을 것입니다.\\n\\n### 4. 업무 환경의 변화\\nAI의 활용은 기존의 업무 환경과 문화를 근본적으로 변화시키고 있습니다. 예를 들어, 물류 및 운송 산업에서는 온라인 쇼핑의 증가로 물류 직원에 대한 수요가 급증했으며, IT 및 커뮤니케이션 분야에서는 프로그래머와 데이터 과학자의 필요성이 증가하고 있습니다. 이러한 변화에 따라 직장의 목적과 필요가 재구성되며, 직원들의 행복은 일의 의미와 팀워크에 크게 의존하게 됩니다.\\n\\n### 5. 기업 문화의 재구성\\n원격 근무가 일상화됨에 따라 팀 간 연결과 공동체 의식을 더욱 강화할 필요가 있습니다. 기업들은 비폭력적인 환경을 조성하고 협업 기회를 증대시켜 직원들의 유대감을 높이는 한편, 지속 가능성과 유연성을 기반으로 한 강력한 업무 문화를 형성하고 있습니다.\\n\\n![AI 시대의 기업 문화 설계](https://example.com/image1.jpg)  \\n*AI가 기업 문화와 조직 구조를 변화시키고 있는 시점입니다.*\\n\\n2025년, 에이전틱 AI가 제공하는 도전과 기회는 기업의 미래를 결정짓는 중요한 요인이 될 것입니다. 기업들은 AI가 가져오는 변화를 수용하고, 이를 통해 직원들이 더 나은 환경에서 함께 성장할 수 있도록 노력해야 합니다. 지속적인 혁신과 협업이 이 시점에서 필수적이며, 기업 리더들은 이를 바탕으로 더욱 현명하고 유연하게 대응해야 할 것입니다.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 여행 및 환대 산업에서 AI 에이전트가 제공하는 고객 경험의 혁신은?\\n\\n최근 몇 년간 인공지능(AI)의 발전은 여행 및 환대 산업에서 고객 경험을 혁신적으로 변화시키고 있습니다.
